   Media Server appears offline, then this is software problem. Otherwise it is likely to be hardware problem and hard reset may be needed
 - Health monitor improvements:
    - Added ping, show log and server issues button.
        - Added checkbox graphs enabling/disabling.
    - Added network usage in Health Monitoring.

 - Now panoramic cameras are supported in Web client
 - Basically the software forces cameras to change primary and secondary streams settings to desired values (FPS/quality). Now it is possible to 
   leave the settings previously configured. I.e. it is possible to set up specific resolution, FPS and quality for first and second streams 
   on a camera's web page and these particular settings will be used in the software. Warning: this is the expert mode feature!
