   It is possible to create several zoom windows from a single item

 - E-mapping. Now it is possible to set a picture (map or building plan) as layout's background and bound items to it. 
 
 - History of events and actions is implemented. All events and actions are displayed in the table that provides 
   the ability to sort and filter data. Additionally "Check server issues..", "Check camera issues.." are added to 
   Media Servers' and Cameras' Context Menus.
   
 - Cameras List is introduced. It displays all Cameras in the table that provides the ability to sort and filter data.

   estimate its power. Use context menu to adjust this feature's settings. Additionally it is possible to export video with such setting
   
 - It is possible to adjust second stream quality in cameras' settings. This is not recommended in general but may be needed for some reasons
 
 - If motion is occured on an item, it is indicated by the visual effect

IMPROVEMENTS:  

 - Client Startup:
   - Autoconnection can be activated on the login page. It will use the pre-entered user name and password to connect to the server automatically
   - Ability to run client when the computer boots up
   - If Client connects to the systen that contain different versions of server components (i.e EC 1.5.1, MS1 1.5.0 and MS2 1.5.1), 
     the warning will be given
   - Login dialog opens much faster
     
 - Client UI Main Controls:

   - Scene:
     - It is possible to traverse all items without mouse (UP, LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN). In previous versions the navigation worked a bit differently
     - Current time is always displayed under playback buttons         
     - UI tabs settings (pinned or hidden tabs) are always saved between Client launches     
     - Added proper cursors when resize rotated items     
     - If resize a video on scene, then all texts (Unauthorized, NO SIGNAL etc.) on it were the same size. Now they are resized as well
   - Tree: 
     - If a camera has issues, it is marked by the exclamation point
     - Events and Actions can be called from the Tree Context menu (System)
     - Backup/Restore can be invoked from the "System" Context Menu in Tree...
     - Thumbnails are shown in Resource Tree if hover with a mouse cursor on a camera     
   
   - Main window is repainted when aero is turned on/off
   - User settings dialog can be resized horizontally
   - Added ping button to Media Server settings dialog. It may be useful to check computer state: if the computer is pinging but 
     Media Server appears offline, then this is software problem. Otherwise it is likely to be hardware problem and hard reset may be needed     
   - Camera selection form (in Events/Actions and Copy Schedule dialogs) is redesigned: click marks camera as selected
   - Smart Search and Motion Mask configuration are more intuitive (different cursors are used)
   
 - Screen Recording:
   - Recorded files are displayed correctly in Windows Media Player even if had been recorded with high quality
   - Recorded files are displayed better if recording "Application Window"     

 - Camera Settings:   
   - Basically the software forces cameras to change primary and secondary streams settings to desired values (FPS/quality). Now it is possible to 
     leave the settings previously configured. I.e. it is possible to set up specific resolution, FPS and quality for first and second streams 
     on a camera's web page and these particular settings will be used in the software. Warning: this is the expert mode feature!
   - Default motion sensitivity for motion dialog is changed to 5 (used to be 8)
   - "Open Item" button is added to Camera Setings form. It opens the current camera in a new tab

   - If an item has been zoomed using mouse wheel, then double click unzooms it and does full PTZ unzoom as well
   - PTZ Controls are rotated automatically if rotate the item and remain in proper positions     
   - Hotkeys can be assigned for PTZ presets (0-9)

 - Events and Actions:
   - Notifications settings are stored in the database so now they are same for all computers the user logs from. Used to be stored independently in the registry
   - Aggregation column is added to Event and Action (used to be in advanced E&A settings)
 
 - Manual Camera Addition:
   - If try to add an existing camera manually the software used to reply "No cameras found". Now it displays such cameras 
     but they cannot be added once more

   - Localized datetime format is used in Time Line (depends on regional settings)
