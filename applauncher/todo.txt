settings:
    - versionToLaunch. Can be updated by module if launch of another version is required
    - previousLaunchedVersion. On successful application launch, module version is saved here


- only single process instance is allowed
    - if second instance is launched, it should maximize any running application window and exit
- having launched client, waits for all client processes to terminate
    - if versionToLaunch != previousLaunchedVersion, then starting client of version versionToLaunch
    - otherwise, exiting
- receives (e.g., using named pipe) tasks from application instances to launch another version
    - task parameters include:
        - versionToLaunch
        - command-line parameters
- downloads some document with application download urls and mirrors

- implemented as fsm
- main states:
    - determines, which module to launch
    - launches module
    - downloads module
    - installs module
- determine version to launch:
    - "versionToLaunch" value
    - "previousLaunchedVersion" value
    - most recent installed version
- just after start reads versionToLaunch setting
    - if no versionToLaunch specified, launches "previousLaunchedVersion" installed module with largest version
- if no required version installed, downloads it and installs
    - on failure to download/install required version prints error message and
        - if there is previousLaunchedVersion, asks to launch previous launched version
        - if there is no previousLaunchedVersion but there are installed version(s), asks to launch most recent version
        - if there is no any versions installed, prints error on screen and asks user to manualy download and install application
    - downloaded file should be saved to some known directory so that not download already downloaded (but not yet installed) version
- launches required version
    - on success updates "previousLaunchedVersion" setting with launched version
    - on failure, prints error message and
        - asks user to launch previousLaunchedVersion if differs from tried version
        - asks user to launch most recent-installed version if differs from tried version
        - nothing, just error message

- if everything goes well, user should not know about launcher (no windows, no messages on screen) during launch phase
- while downloading and installing, progress bar should be visible

- should leave some place for download-related interaction with user for possible future requests

- platform-dependent code:
    - determiming installed versions
    - installation. On Unix, root privileges are required so "Enter sudo password" window should appear
