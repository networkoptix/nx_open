/**
 * @class IBayerAverageMap
 *
 * The Bayer average map provides local averages of the capture's raw pixels for a number
 * of small rectangular regions, called bins, that are evenly distributed across the image.
 * Each average is a floating-point value that is nomalized such that [0.0, 1.0] maps to the
 * full optical range of the output pixels, but values outside this range may be included in
 * the averages so long as they are within the working range of the average calculation
 * (@see IBayerAverageMap::getWorkingRange()). Pixels outside of the working range will be
 * excluded from average calculation and added to the clipped count for the region
 * (@see IBayerAverageMap::getClipCounts()).
 *
 * The size and layout of the bins used to calculate the averages are determined by the Argus
 * implementation and are illustrated in the following diagram. The bin size and interval are
 * constant across the image, and are positioned such that the generated averages cover the
 * majority of the full image. All dimensions are given in pixels.
