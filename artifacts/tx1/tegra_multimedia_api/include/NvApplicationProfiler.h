/**

 * @c %NvApplicationProfiler is a helper class for profiling the overall application
 * resource usage.
 *
 * NvApplicationProfiler spawns a background thread which periodically measures resource
 * usage. This sampling interval can be configured. Smaller sampling intervals
 * may lead to more accurate results but the background thread itself will
 * have a higher CPU usage.
 *
 * Only one instance of NvApplicationProfiler object gets created for the application.
 * It can be accessed using getProfilerInstance().
 *
 * NvApplicationProfiler currently samples CPU usage and provides peak and average CPU
 * usage during the profiling duration. It requires that the CPU frequency be
 * constant over the entire duration. To force this, NvApplicationProfiler will start only
 * when the CPU governor is set to @b performance.
