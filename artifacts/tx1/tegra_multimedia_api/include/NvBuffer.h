/**
 * @brief Class representing a buffer.
 *
 * The NvBuffer class is modeled on the basis of the @c v4l2_buffer
 * structure. The buffer has @c buf_type @c v4l2_buf_type, @c
 * memory_type @c v4l2_memory, and an index. It contains an
 * NvBufferPlane array similar to the array of @c v4l2_plane
 * structures in @c v4l2_buffer.m.planes. It also contains a
 * corresponding NvBufferPlaneFormat array that describes the
 * format of each of the planes.
 *
 * Even though @c %NvBuffer closely resembles v4l2 structures, it can
 * be easily used with other non-v4l2 components. @c %NvBuffer
 * contains data pointers, buffer length, file descriptor (FD) of
 * buffer planes, buffer format (height, width, stride, etc.), and
 * other members that are required by such components.
 *
 * This class also provides buffer reference count functionality. This
 * is useful when the same buffer is being used by multiple elements.
 *
 * In the case of a V4L2 MMAP, this class provides convenience methods
 * for mapping or unmapping the contents of the buffer to or from
 * memory, allocating or deallocating software memory depending on its
 * format.
