This directory contains the modified source code of date-time formatting utilities from the Qt
library.

The most matching Qt version seems to be 5.1.0.

The original implementation resides at `src/corelib/tools/qlocale.cpp`.

The original content was taken from
https://download.qt.io/new_archive/qt/5.1/5.1.0/single/qt-everywhere-opensource-src-5.1.0.zip, and
then the code has been rewritten by Network Optix, Inc.
