Rebuild of this library is only needed to add more functionality wsdl.

Library binaries/headers are in the build_environment dir, so there is no need to build this library.
This library source code is generated by gsoap 2.8.8 from several onvif wsdl.


To add some more interfaces:

- !!!! All files (especially, *.c) MUST be compiled with c++ compiler !!!!
- add wsdl url to wsdl2h call in .bat 
- optionally, add new namespace(s) alias to typemap.dat
- execute wsdl2h with parameters from src/get_onvif_stub.bat 
- in generated file onvif.h find line #import "ns1.h", comment it and add following lines right after it:
    //#import "ns1.h"	// ns1 = <http://www.w3.org/2005/08/addressing>
    #import "wsse.h"
    #import "wsa.h"
    #import "wsdd10.h"
- find line "#define SOAP_NAMESPACE_OF_ns1 "" and remove corresponding block of text
- run soapcpp2 with parameters found in get_onvif_stub.bat
- add new files to project file and rebuild project
- I add non standart AMR audio codec. to sources. You MUST add AMR audio codec to WSDL if you going to update sources!!! - rvasilenko
