@section synopsis Synopsis

@SYNOPSIS@

designfilter computes the coefficients of a FIR
filter with a given frequency response. The user supplies the
frequency response as a vector of evenly spaced gains ranging from 0
to half the sampling frequency. The length of this vector must be a
power of 2. The filter coefficients can be used by the \ref sigfilter_manual 
program.
