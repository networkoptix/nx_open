When building a new diphone based voice for a supported language, such 
as English, the upper parts of the systems can mostly be taken from 
existing voices, thus making the building task simpler. Of course, 
things can still go wrong, and its worth checking everything at each 
stage. This section gives the basic walkthrough for building a new US 
English voice. Support for building UK (southern, RP dialect) is also 
provided this way. For building non-US/UK synthesizers see 
<xref linkend="bsv-jpdiphone-ch">
for a similar walkthrough but also covering the full text, lexicona
nd prosody issues which we can subsume in this example.

<para>
Recording a whole diphone set usually takes a number of hours, <emphasis>if</emphasis> 
everything goes to plan. Construction of the voice after recording may 
take another couple of hours, though much of this is CPU bound. Then 
hand-correction may take at least another few hours (depending on the 
quality). Thus if all goes well it is possible to construct a new voice 
in a day's work though usually something goes wrong and it takes longer. 
The more time you spend making sure the data is correctly aligned and 
labeled, the better the results will be. While something can be made 
quickly, it can take much longer to do it very well. 
</para>
<para>
For those of you who have ignored the rest of this document and are just 
hoping to get by by reading this, good luck. It may be possible to do 
that, but considering the time you'll need to invest to build a voice, 
being familar with the comments, at least in the rest of this chapter, 
may be well worth the time invested.

<para>
As with all parts of <filename>festvox</filename>, you must set the following 
environment variables to where you have installed versions of 
the Edinburgh Speech Tools and the festvox distribution 
<blockquote><literallayout>
export ESTDIR=/home/awb/projects/speech_tools
export FESTVOXDIR=/home/awb/projects/festvox
</literallayout></blockquote>
The next stage is to select a directory to build the voice. You will 
need in the order of 500M of diskspace to do this, it could 
be done in less, but its better to have enough to start with. Make a 
new directory and cd into it 
<blockquote><literallayout>
mkdir ~/data/cmu_us_awb_diphone
cd ~/data/cmu_us_awb_diphone
</literallayout></blockquote>
By convention, the directory is named for the institution, the language 
(here, <filename>us</filename> English) and the speaker 
(<filename>awb</filename>, who actually 
speaks with a Scottish accent). Although it can be fixed later, the 
directory name is used when festival searches for available voices, so 
it is good to follow this convention.

<indexterm><primary> generating diphone skeleton files </primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary> setup_diphone </primary></indexterm>
Build the basic directory structure 
<blockquote><literallayout>
$FESTVOXDIR/src/diphones/setup_diphone cmu us awb
</literallayout></blockquote>
the arguments to <filename>setup_diphone</filename> are, the institution building the 
voice, the language, and the name of the speaker. If you don't have a 
institution we recommend you use <filename>net</filename>. There is an ISO standard 
for language names, though unfortunately it doesn't allow distinction 
between US and UK English, so in general we recommend you use the two 
letter form, though for US English use <filename>us</filename> and UK English use 
<filename>uk</filename>. The speaker name may or may nor be there actual name. 
</para>
<para>
The setup script builds the basic directory structure and copies in various 
skeleton files. For languages <filename>us</filename> and <filename>uk</filename> it copies in 
files with much of the details filled in for those languages, for other 
languages the skeleton files are much more skeletal. 
</para>
<para>
<indexterm><primary> English voice requirements </primary></indexterm>
For constructing a <filename>us</filename> voice you must have the following installed 
in your version of festival 
<blockquote><literallayout>
festvox_kallpc16k
festlex_POSLEX
festlex_CMU
</literallayout></blockquote>
And for a UK voice you need 
<blockquote><literallayout>
festvox_rablpc16k
festlex_POSLEX
festlex_OALD
</literallayout></blockquote>
At run-time the two appropriate festlex packages (POSLEX + dialect 
specific lexicon) will be required but not the existing kal/rab voices. 
</para>
<para>
<indexterm><primary> diphone schema </primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary> nonsense word list </primary></indexterm>
To generate the nonsense word list 
<blockquote><literallayout>
festival -b festvox/diphlist.scm festvox/us_schema.scm \
     '(diphone-gen-schema "us" "etc/usdiph.list")'
</literallayout></blockquote>
<indexterm><primary> nonsense word prompts </primary></indexterm>
We use a synthesized voice to build waveforms of the prompts, both for 
actual prompting and for alignment. If you want to 
change the prompt voice (e.g. to a female) edit <filename>festvox/us_schema.scm</filename>. 
Near the end of the file is the function <varname>Diphone_Prompt_Setup</varname>. 
By default (for US English) the voice <varname>(voice_kal_diphone)</varname> is 
called. Change that, and the F0 value in the following line, if appropriate, 
to the voice use wish to follow. 
</para>
<para>
Then to synthesize the prompts 
<blockquote><literallayout>
festival -b festvox/diphlist.scm festvox/us_schema.scm \
      '(diphone-gen-waves "prompt-wav" "prompt-lab" "etc/usdiph.list")'
</literallayout></blockquote>
</para>
<para>
<indexterm><primary> recording nonsense words </primary></indexterm>
Now record the prompts. Care should be taken to set up the recording 
environment so it is best. Note all power levels so that if more than 
one session is required you can continue and still get the same 
recording quality. Given the length of the US English list, its 
unlikely a person can say allow of these in one sitting without taking 
breaks at least, so ensuring the environment can be duplicated is 
important, even if it's only after a good stretch and a drink of water. 
<blockquote><literallayout>
bin/prompt_them etc/usdiph.list
</literallayout></blockquote>
Note a third argument can be given to state which nonse word to begin 
prompting from. This if you have already recorded the first 100 you 
can continue with 
<blockquote><literallayout>
bin/prompt_them etc/usdiph.list 101
</literallayout></blockquote>
See <xref linkend="bsv-usphoneset-sect"> for notes on pronunciation (or 
<xref linkend="bsv-ukphoneset-sect"> for the UK version). 
</para>
<para>
<indexterm><primary> autolabeling nonsense words </primary></indexterm>
The recorded prompts can the be labeled by 
<blockquote><literallayout>
bin/make_labs prompt-wav/*.wav
</literallayout></blockquote>
Its is always worthwhile correcting the autolabeling. Use 
<blockquote><literallayout>
emulabel etc/emu_lab
</literallayout></blockquote>
and select <varname>FILE OPEN</varname> from the top menu bar and the place the 
other dialog box and clink inside it and hit return. A list of all 
label files will be given. Double-click on each of these to see the 
labels, spectragram and waveform. (** reference to "How to correct 
labels" required **). 
</para>
<para>
Once the diphone labels have been corrected, the diphone index may be 
built by 
<blockquote><literallayout>
bin/make_diph_index etc/usdiph.list dic/awbdiph.est
</literallayout></blockquote>
</para>
<para>
<indexterm><primary> pitchmarks from waveforms </primary></indexterm>
If no EGG signal has been collected you can extract the 
pitchmarks by (though read <xref linkend="bsv-pitchmarks-sect">
to ensure you are getting the best exteraction). 
<blockquote><literallayout>
bin/make_pm_wave wav/*.wav
</literallayout></blockquote>
If you do have an EGG signal then use the following instead 
<blockquote><literallayout>
bin/make_pm lar/*.lar
</literallayout></blockquote>
A program to move the predicted pitchmarks to the nearest 
peak in the waveform is also provided. This is almost always 
a good idea, even for EGG extracted pitch marks 
<blockquote><literallayout>
bin/make_pm_fix pm/*.pm
</literallayout></blockquote>
Getting good pitchmarks is important to the quality of the synthesis, 
see <xref linkend="bsv-pitchmarks-sect"> for more discussion. 
</para>
<para>
Because there is often a power mismatch through a set of diphone 
we provided a simple method for finding what general power difference 
exist between files. This finds the mean power for each vowel in 
each file and calculates a factor with respect to the overall mean 
vowel power. A table of power modifiers for each file can 
be calculated by 
<blockquote><literallayout>
bin/find_powerfactors lab/*.lab
</literallayout></blockquote>
The factors calculated by this are saved in <filename>etc/powfacts</filename>. 
</para>
<para>
Then build the pitch-synchronous LPC coefficients, which use 
the power factors if they've been calculated. 
<blockquote><literallayout>
bin/make_lpc wav/*.wav
</literallayout></blockquote>
</para>
<para>
<indexterm><primary> testing a generated voice </primary></indexterm>
Now the database is ready for its initial tests. 
<blockquote><literallayout>
festival festvox/cmu_us_awb_diphone.scm '(voice_cmu_us_awb_diphone)'
</literallayout></blockquote>
When there has been no hand correction of the labels this stage may fail 
with diphones not having proper start, mid and end values. This happens 
when the automatic labeled has position two labels at the same point. 
For each diphone that has a problem find out which file it comes from 
(grep for it in <filename>dic/awbdiph.est</filename> and use <filename>emulabel</filename> to change 
the labeling to as its correct. For example suppose "ah-m" is wrong 
you'll find is comes from <filename>us_0314</filename>. Thus type 
<blockquote><literallayout>
emulabel etc/emu_lab us_0314
</literallayout></blockquote>
After correcting labels you must re-run the <filename>make_diph_index</filename> 
command. You should also re-run the <filename>find_powerfacts</filename> stage 
and <filename>make_lpc</filename> stages as these too depend on the labels, but 
this takes longer to run and perhaps that need only be done when 
you've corrected many labels. 
</para>
<para>
To test the voice's basic functionality with 
<blockquote><literallayout>
festival> (SayPhones '(pau hh ax l ow pau))

festival> (intro)
</literallayout></blockquote>
As the autolabeling is unlikely to work completely you should 
listen to a number of examples to find out what diphones have 
gone wrong. 
</para>

<indexterm><primary> group files </primary></indexterm>
Finally, once you have corrected the errors (did we mention you need to 
check and correct the errors?), you can build a final voice suitable for 
distribution. First you need to create a group file which contains only 
the subparts of spoken words which contain the diphones. 
<blockquote><literallayout>
festival festvox/cmu_us_awb_diphone.scm '(voice_cmu_us_awb_diphone)'
...
festival (us_make_group_file "group/awblpc.group" nil)
...
</literallayout></blockquote>
The <varname>us_</varname> in this function name confusingly stands for 
<varname>UniSyn</varname> (the unit concatenation subsystem in Festival) and nothing 
to do with US English. 
</para>
<para>
To test this edit <filename>festvox/cmu_us_awb_diphone.scm</filename> and 
change the choice of databases used from separate to grouped. This is 
done by commenting out the line (around line 81) 
<blockquote><literallayout>
(set! cmu_us_awb_db_name (us_diphone_init cmu_us_awb_lpc_sep))
</literallayout></blockquote>
and uncommented the line (around line 84) 
<blockquote><literallayout>
(set! cmu_us_awb_db_name (us_diphone_init cmu_us_awb_lpc_group))
</literallayout></blockquote>
<indexterm><primary> adding a voice to festival </primary></indexterm>
The next stage is to integrate this new voice so that festival can find 
it automatically. To do this, you should add a symbolic link from the 
voice directory of Festival's English voices to the directory containing 
the new voice. First cd to festival's voice directory (this will vary 
depending on where you installed festival) 
<blockquote><literallayout>
cd /home/awb/projects/festival/lib/voices/english/
</literallayout></blockquote>
add a symbolic link back to where your voice was built 
<blockquote><literallayout>
ln -s /home/awb/data/cmu_us_awb_diphone
</literallayout></blockquote>
Now this new voice will be available for anyone runing that version festival 
(started from any directory) 
<blockquote><literallayout>
festival
...
festival> (voice_cmu_us_awb_diphone)
...
festival> (intro)
...
</literallayout></blockquote>
<indexterm><primary> building a voice distribution </primary></indexterm>
The final stage is to generate a distribution file so the voice may 
be installed on other's festival installations. Before you do 
this you must add a file <filename>COPYING</filename> to the directory you 
built the diphone database in. This should state the terms and conditions 
in which people may use, distribute and modify the voice. 
</para>
<para>
Generate the distribution tarfile in the directory above the festival 
installation (the one where <filename>festival/</filename> and <filename>speech_tools/</filename> 
directory is). 
<blockquote><literallayout>
cd /home/awb/projects/
tar zcvf festvox_cmu_us_awb_lpc.tar.gz \
  festival/lib/voices/english/cmu_us_awb_diphone/festvox/*.scm \
  festival/lib/voices/english/cmu_us_awb_diphone/COPYING \
  festival/lib/voices/english/cmu_us_awb_diphone/group/awblpc.group
</literallayout></blockquote>
