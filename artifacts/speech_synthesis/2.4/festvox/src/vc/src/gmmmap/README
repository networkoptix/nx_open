Program for GMM Mapping
* FOR LITTLE ENDIAN

usage: gmmmap [options...] [inputfile] [outputfile]
options:
        -xdim xdim[20]                  : dimension of source vector
        -ydim ydim[20]                  : dimension of target vector
        -gmmfile gmmfile                : GMM parameter file
        -wseqfile wseqfile              : get weight sequence file
        -mseqfile mseqfile              : get mean sequence file
        -covfile covfile                : get covariance file
        -clsseqfile clsseqfile          : get class sequence file
        -dia                            : diagonal covariance
        -file                           : file processing
        -vit                            : viterbi search
        -nmsg                           : no message
        -help                           : display this message

Input and output files are binary files of source and converted
vectors. The number of dimensions of the source vector and that of the
target vector are changed by -xdim and -ydim, respectively.

A binary parameter file for the GMM mapping is necessary and it is
used by -gmmfile. If -dia is used, the GMM parameter has not full but
diagonal covariances. If -vit is used, Viterbi mixture selection is
performed.

Conditional PDF sequences in individual mixtures are represented by
weight sequences, mean vector sequences and covariance matrices.
Binary files of these parameters are generated by -wseqfile, -mseqfile
and -covfile.

When using the Viterbi mixture selection by -vit, the conditional PDF
sequence in the selected mixtures is represented by a weight sequence,
a mean sequence, covariance matrices, and a mixture-index sequence.
Binary files of these parameters are generated by -wseqfile, -covfile,
and -clsseqfile.
* Note that the mean sequence is the same as output converted vectors.

If -file is used, CPU memory can be saved

Binary data has double-type format.

Some messages are printed while executing this program. If you
don't need those messages, use -nmsg.


<EXAMPLE>
% gmmmap \
	-xdim 24 \
	-ydim 14 \
	-gmmfile input.param \
	-wseqfile output.wseq \
	-mseqfile output.mseq \
	-covfile output.cov \
	intput.vecs \
	output.vecs
