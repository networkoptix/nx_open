Program for F0 Linear Mapping
* FOR LITTLE ENDIAN

usage: f0map [options...] [inputfile] [outputfile]
options:
        -ostfile ostfile                : original statistics file
        -tstfile tstfile                : target statistics file
        -log                            : statistics of log F0
        -nmsg                           : no message
        -help                           : display this message

Input and output files are F0 text file where each F0 is
represented by Hz.

Statistics text files describing mean and standard deviation as follows:
150.0
50.0
are necessary. The first value shows mean and the second value shows
standard deviation. The statistics file before conversion is used by
-ostfile, and that after conversion is used by -tstfile.  Input F0s
are converted with a simple linear conversion as follows:
 conv F0 =
  (org F0 - [org mean]) / [org stdev] * [tar stdev] + [tar mean].

If -log is used, log-scale F0 conversion is performed.
* Note that statistics text files should describe mean and standard
deviation of the log-scaled F0.

Some messages are printed while executing this program. If you
don't need those messages, use -nmsg.


<EXAMPLE>
% f0map \
	-ostfile input.ost \
	-tstfile input.tst \
	-log \
	-nmsg \
	input.f0 \
	output.f0
