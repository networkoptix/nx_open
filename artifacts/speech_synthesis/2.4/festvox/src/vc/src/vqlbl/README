Program for VQ Labeling and Calculation of Weights and Covariances
* FOR LITTLE ENDIAN

usage: vqlbl [options...] [inputfile] [outputfile]
options:
        -dim dim[48]                    : dimension of vector
        -cbookfile cbookfile            : codebook file
        -weightfile weightfile          : get weight matrix file
        -covfile covfile                : get covariance matrix file
        -ldist                          : allowing large distance
        -nmsg                           : no message
        -help                           : display this message

The input file is a binary file of feature vectors. A binary file of
codebook centroids is necessary and it is used by -cbookfile. The
output file is a binary file of codebook indexes. The output data has
long-type format.

The number of dimensions of feature vectors is changed by -dim.

Initial parameters for training a GMM, i.e., weights and covariance
matrices are generated by -weightfile and -covfile.

When performing VQ, the maximum distance between the nearest centroid
vector and each feature vector is limited. This constraint is canceled
by -ldist.

Binary data except for the output file has double-type format.

Some messages are printed while executing this program. If you
don't need those messages, use -nmsg.


<EXAMPLE>
% vqlbl \
	-dim 39 \
	-cbookfile input.cbook \
	-weightfile ouput.wghts \
	-covfile output.covs \
	-nmsg \
	input.vecs \
	output.idxs
