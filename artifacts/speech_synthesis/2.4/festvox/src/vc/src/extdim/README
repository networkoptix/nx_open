Program for Component Extraction of Specific Dimension
* FOR LITTLE ENDIAN

usage: extdim [options...] [inputfile] [outputfile]
options:
        -dim dim[25]                    : dimension of vector
        -sd sd[0]                       : start dim
        -ed ed[-1]                      : end dim
        -sf sf[0]                       : start frame
        -ef ef[-1]                      : end frame
        -jf jf[0]                       : jump frame
        -chinf chinf                    : channel file
        -txt                            : text output
        -eprt                           : e print
        -nmsg                           : no message
        -help                           : display this message

Input and output files are binary files of vectors. If -txt is used,
the output file is a text file.  Moreover, If both -txt and -eprt are
used, the output text file has exponential format such as 2.0e-8.

The [sd]-th through the [ed]-th dimensional components at the [sf]-th
through the [ef]-th frames are extracted, where [sd], [ed], [sf], and
[ef] are changed by -sf, -ed, -sf, and -ef, respectively. The number
of dimensions of input vectors is changed by -dim. The number of
skipped frames is changed by -jf.

Any dimensional component can be extracted by using -chinf. A text
file describing extracted dimensions is necessary. For example, in
order to extract the 1st, the 4th, and the 5th dimensional components
from six dimensional vectors consisting of the 0th through the 5th
dimensional components, the text file describing as follows:
0.0
1.0
0.0
0.0
1.0
1.0
is used.

Binary data has double-type format.

Some messages are printed while executing this program. If you
don't need those messages, use -nmsg.


<EXAMPLE>
% extdim \
	-dim 24 \
	-sd 2 \
	-ed 8 \
	-sf 5 \
	-ef 100 \
	-txt \
	-eprt \
	-nmsg \
	input.vecs \
	output.vecs.txt
