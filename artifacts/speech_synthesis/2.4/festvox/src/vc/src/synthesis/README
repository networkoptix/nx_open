Program for Speech Synthesis
* FOR LITTLE ENDIAN

usage: synthesis [options...] [inf0file] [inmcepfile] [outputfile]
options:
        -f samp_freq[16000.0]           : sampling frequency [Hz]
        -frame frame[5.0]               : frame length [ms]
        -order order[24]                : cepstrum order
        -rmcepfile rmcepfile            : reference mel-cep file
        -raw                            : input raw file (16bit short)
        -float                          : input float
        -nmsg                           : no message
        -help                           : display this message

Two Input files are an F0 [Hz] text file and a binary file of a
mel-cepstral sequence including the 0th coefficients. The output file
is a wav file (RIFF WAVE). If -raw is used, the output is a raw file
(little endian short-type format).

A sampling frequency is changed by -f. A frame length is changed by
-frame. A mel-cepstral order is changed by -order.
* Note that a coefficient for mel-frequency warping is set to 0.42 for
16 kHz sampling in analysis_sub.h, Line 48.

Power can be controlled so that the output waveform has the same power
as a waveform synthesized by a specific mel-cepstral sequence has. A
binary file of the specific mel-cep is used by -rmcepfile.
* Note that the size of the reference mel-cep should be equal to that
of the input mel-cepstral sequence.

Binary data has double-type format. If -float is used, data has
float-type format.

Some messages are printed while executing this program. If you
don't need those messages, use -nmsg.


<EXAMPLE>

	-frame 10.0 \
	-order 29 \
	-rmcepfile input.rmcep \
	-nmsg \
	input.f0 \
	input.mcep \
	output.wav
