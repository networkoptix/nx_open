><P
>The goal of building such limited domain synthesizer is not just 
to show off good synthesis. We followed this route as we see this 
as a very practical method for building speech output systems. </P
><P
>For practical reasons, the default configures includes the possibility of 
a back-up voice that will be called to do synthesis if the limited 
domain synthesizer fails, which for this default setup means the phrase 
includes a out of vocabulary word. It would perhaps be more useful if 
the fall position just required synthesis of the out of vocabulary word 
itself rather than the whole phrase, but that isn't as trivial as it 
might be. The limit domain synthesis does not prosody modification of 
the selections, except for pitch smooth at joins, thus slotting in a 
diphone one word would sound very bad. At present each limited domain 
synthesizer has an explicitly defined <CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>closest_voice</CODE
>. This voice 
is used when the limited domain synthesis fails and also when generating 
the prompts, which can be looked upon as absolute minimal case when the 
synthesizer has no data to synthesize from. </P
><P
>There are also issues in speed here, which we are still trying to 
improve. This technique should in fact be fast but it is still slower 
than our diphone synthesizer. One significant reason is the cost if 
finding the optimal join put in selected units. Also this synthesizer 
technique require more memory that diphones as the cepstrum parameters 
for the whole database are required at run time, in addition to the full 
waveforms. These issues we feel can and should be addressed as these 
techniques are not fundamentally computationally expensive so we intend 
to work on these aspect in later releases. </P
