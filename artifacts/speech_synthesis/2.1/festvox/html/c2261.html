>&#13;The basic idea behind building diphone databases is to explicitly list 
all possible phone-phone transitions in a language. This makes the 
incorrect but practical and simplifying assumption that co-articulatory 
effects never go over more than two phones. The exact definition of 
<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>phone</I
> here is in general nontrivial, and what a "standard" phone 
set should be is not uncontroversial -- various allophonic variations, 
such as light and dark /l/, may also be included. Unlike generalized 
unit selection where multiple occurrences of phones may exists with 
various distinguishing features, in a diphone database only one 
occurrence of each diphone is recorded. This makes selection much 
easier but also makes for a large laborious collection task. </P
><P
>&#13;
In general, the number of diphones in a language is the square of the 
number of phones. However, in natural human languages, there are 
phonotactic constraints -- some phone-phone pairs, even whole classes of 
phones-phone combinations, may not occur at all. These gaps are common 
in the world's languages. The exact definition of <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>never exist</I
> is 
also problematic. Humans can often generate those so-called 
non-existent diphones if they try, and one must always think about phone 
pairs that cross over word boundaries as well, but even then, certain 
combinations cannot exist; for example, /hh/ /ng/ in English is probably 
impossible (we would probably insert a schwa). /ng/ may really only 
appears after the vowel in a syllable (in coda position); however, in 
other languages it can appear in syllable-initial position. /hh/ cannot 
appear at the end of a syllable, though sometimes it may be pronounced 
when trying to add aspiration to open vowels. </P
><P
>Diphone synthesis, and more generally any concatenative synthesis 
method, makes an absolutely fixed choice about which units exist, and in 
circumstances where something else is required, a mapping is necessary. 
When humans are given a context where an unusual phone is desired, for 
example in a foreign word, they will (often) attempt to produce it even 
though it falls outside their basic phonetic vocabulary. The 
articulatory system is flexible enough to produce (or attempt to 
produce) unfamiliar phones, as we all share the same underlying physical 
structures. Concatenative synthesizers, however, have a fixed 
inventory, and cannot reasonably be made to produce anything outside 
their pre-defined vocabulary. Formant and articulatory synthesizers 
have the advantage here. This is a basic trade off, concatenative 
synthesizers typically produce much more natural synthesis than formants 
synthesizer but at the cost of being only able to produce those phones 
defined within their inventory. </P
><P
>&#13;Since we wish to build voices for arbitrary text-to-speech systems which 
may include unusual phones, some mapping, typically at the lexical 
level, can be used to ensure all the required diphones lie within the 
recorded inventory. The resulting voice will therefore be limited, and 
unusual phones will lie outside its range. This in many cases is 
acceptable though if the voice is specifically to be used for 
pronouncing Scottish place names it would be advisable to include the 
/X/ phone as in "loch". </P
><P
>&#13;In addition to the base phones, various allophonic variations may also 
be considered. Flapping, as when the /t/ becoming a /dx/ in the word 
"butter" is an example of an allophonic variation reduction which 
occurs naturally in American English, and including flaps in the phone 
set makes the synthetic speech more natural. Stressed and unstressed 
vowels in Spanish, consonant cluster /r/ verses lone /r/ in English, 
inter-syllabic diphones verses intra-syllabic ones -- variations like 
these are well worth considering. Ideally, all such possible variations 
should be included in a diphone list, but the more variations you 
include, the larger the diphone set will be -- remember the general rule 
that the number of diphones is nearly the square of the number of 
phones. This affects recording time, labeling time and ultimately the 
database size. Duplicating all the vowels (e.g. stressed/unstressed 
versions) will significantly increase the database size. </P

These inventory questions are open, and depending on the resources you 
are willing or able to devote, can be extended considerably. It should 
be clear, however, that such a list is simply a basic set. Alternative 
synthesis methods and inventories of different unit sizes may produce 
better results for the amount of work (or data collected). 
Demi-syllable databases and mixed inventory methods such as Hadifix 
[<SPAN
CLASS="CITATION"
>portele96</SPAN
>] may give better results under some conditions. Still, 
controlling the inventory and using acoustic measures rather than 
linguistic knowledge to define the space of possible units in your 
inventory has also been attempted as in work like Whistler 
[<SPAN
CLASS="CITATION"
>huang97</SPAN
>]. The most extreme view where the unit inventory is not 
predefined at all but based solely on what is available in general 
speech databases is CHATR [<SPAN
CLASS="CITATION"
>campbell96</SPAN
>]. </P
><P
>&#13;Although generalized unit selection can produce <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>much</I
> better 
synthesis than diphone techniques, using more units makes selecting 
appropriate ones more difficult. In the basic strategy presented in 
this section, selection of the appropriate unit from the diphone 
inventory is trivial, while in a system like CHATR, selection of the 
appropriate unit is a significantly difficult problem. (See <A
HREF="c2641.html"
>the Chapter called <I
>Unit selection databases</I
></A
> on unit 
selection for more discussion of such techniques). With a 
harder selection task, it is more likely that mistakes will be made, 
which in unit selection can give some selections which are much worse 
worse that diphones, even though other examples may be better. </P
