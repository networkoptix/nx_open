><P
>We currently use autolabel the recorded prompts using the alignment 
technique based on [<SPAN
CLASS="CITATION"
>malfrere97</SPAN
>] that we discussed above for diphone 
labeling. Although this technique works its is not as robust for 
general speech as it is for carefully articulated nonsense words. 
Specifically this technique does not allow for alternative pronunciations 
which are common. </P
><P
>Ideally we should use a more generally speech recognition systems. In 
fact for labeling of unit selection database the bets results would be 
to train a recognition using Baum-Welch on the database until 
convergence. This would give the most consistent labeling. We have 
started initial experiments with using the open source CMU Sphinx 
recognition system are are likely to provide scripts to do this in later 
releases. </P
><P
>In the mean time the greatest problem in predict phone list must be the 
same (or very similar) to what was actually spoken. This can be 
achieved by a knowledge speaker, and by customizing the front end of the 
synthesizer so it produces more natural segments. </P
><P
>Two observations are worth mentioning here. First if the synthesizer 
makes a mistake in pronunciation and the human speaker does not we 
have found the things may work out anyway. For example we found 
the word "hwy" appeared in the prompts, which the synthesizer 
pronounced as "H W Y" while the speaker said "highway". The forced 
alignment however cause the phones in the pronunciation of the letters 
"H W Y" to be aligned with the phones in "highway" thus on selection 
appropriate, though misnamed, phones were selected. However you should

>depend</I
> on such compound errors. </P
><P
>The second observation is that festival includes prediction of vowel 
reduction. We are beginning to feel that such prediction is unnecessary 
in limited domain synthesizer or in unit selection in general. This 
vowel variation can itself be achieve but the clustering technique 
themselves and hence allows a reasonable back-off selection strategy 
than making firm type decisions. </P
