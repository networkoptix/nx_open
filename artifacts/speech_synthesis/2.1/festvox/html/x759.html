>The most common case is when someone wants to make their own voice into 
a synthesizer. Note that the issues in voice modeling of a particular 
speaker are still open research problems. Much of the quality of a 
particular voice comes mostly from the waveform generation method, but 
other aspects of a speaker such as intonation and duration, and 
pronunciation are all part of what makes that person's voice sound like 
them. All of the general-purpose voices we have heard in Festival sound 
like the speaker they were record from (at least as far as we know all 
the speakers), but they also don't have all the qualities of that 
person's voice, though they can be quite convincing for limited-domain 
synthesizers. </P

<A

>the Chapter called <I
>US/UK English Diphone Synthesizer</I

> deals with specifically building 
a new US or UK English voice. This is a relatively easy place to start, 
though of course we encourage reading this entire document. </P
><P
>Another possible solution to getting a new or particular voice is to do 
voice conversion, as is done at the Oregon Graduate Institute (OGI) 
[<SPAN

>kain98</SPAN
>] and elsewhere. OGI have already released new voices based 
on this conversion and may release the conversion code itself, though 
the license terms are not the same as those of Festival or this document. </P

Another aspect of a new voice in an existing language is a voice in a 
new dialect. The requirements are similar to those of creating a voice 
in a new language. The lexicon and intonation probably need to change 
as well as the waveform generation method (a new diphone database). 
Although much of the text analysis came probably be borrowed, be aware 
that simple things like number pronunciation can often change between 
dialects (cf. US and UK English). </P

>&#13;We also do work on limited domain synthesis in the same framework. For 
limited domain synthesis, a reasonably small corpus is collected, and 
used to synthesize a much larger range of utterances in the same basic 
style. We give an example of recording a talking clock, which, although 
built from only 24 recordings, generates over a thousand unique 
utterances; these capture a lot of the latent speaker characteristics 
from the data. </P
