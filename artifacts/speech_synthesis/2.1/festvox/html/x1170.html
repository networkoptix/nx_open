>The above walkthough is to give you a basic idea of the stages involved in 
building a limited domain synthesizer. The quality of a limited domain 
synthesizer will most likely be excellent in parts and very bad in 
others which is typical of techniques like this. Each stage is, of 
course, more complex than this and there are a number of things that can 
be done to improve it. </P
><P
>For limited domain synthesize it should be possible to correct 
the errors such that it is excellent always. To do so though requires 
being able to diagnose where the problems are. The most 
likely problems are listed here

>Mis-labeling
Due to lipsmacks, and other reasons the labeling may not be correct. 
The result may the wrong, extra or missing segments in the synthesized 
utterance. Using <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>emulabel</TT
> you can check and hand correct the 
labels. </P

>Mis-spoken data
The speaker may have made a mistake in the content. This can often 
happen even when the speaker is careful. Mistakes can be actual 
content (it is easy to read a list of number wrongly), but also 
hesitations and false starts can make the recording bad. Also note 
that inconsistent prosodic variation can also affect the synthesis 
quality. Re-recording can be considered for bad examples, 
or you can delete them from the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>etc/LDOM.data</TT
> list, assuming 
there is enough variation in the rest of the examples to ensure 
proper coverage of the domain. </P

>Bad pitchmarking
Automatic pitchmarking is not really automatic. It is very worthwhile 
checking to see if it is correct and re-running the pitchmarking with 
better parameters until it is better. (We need better documentation 
here on how to know what "correct" is.) </P

><P
>Looking at the data
There is never a substitute for actually looking at the data. Use 
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>emulabel</TT
> to actually look at the recorded utterances and see what 
the labeling is. Ensure these match and files haven't got out of 
order. Look at a random selection not just the first example. </P

>Improving the unit clustering The clustering techniques and the
features used here are pretty generic and by no means optimal. Even
for the simple example given here it is not very good. See <A
HREF="c2641.html"
>the Chapter called <I
>Unit selection databases</I
></A
> on unit selection for more discussion on
this. Adding new features for use in cluster may help a lot.</P
></LI
></UL
>
The line between limited domain synthesis and unit selection is fuzzy. 
The more complex and varied the phrases you synthesize are, the more 
difficult it is to produce reliable synthesis. </P
