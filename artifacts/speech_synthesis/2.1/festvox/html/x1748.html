>&#13;
Accent and boundary tones are what we will use, hopefully in a theory 
independent way, to refer to the two main types of intonation event. 
For English, and for many other languages the prediction of position of 
the accents and boundaries can be done as an independent process from F0 
contour generation itself. This is definite true from the major theories 
we will be considering. </P
><P
>As with phrase break prediction there are some simple rules that will go 
a surprisingly long way. And as with most of the other statistical 
learning techniques simple rules cover most of the work, more complex 
rules work better, but the best results are from using the sorts of 
information you were using in rules but statistically training them from 
a appropriate data. </P
><P
>&#13;For English the placement of accents on stressed syllables in 
all content words is a quite reasonable approximation achieving 
about 80% accuracy on typical databases. [<SPAN
CLASS="CITATION"
>hirschberg90</SPAN
>] 
is probably the best example of a detailed rule driven approach 
(for English). CART trees based on the sorts of features Hirschberg 
uses are quite reasonable. Though eventual these rules become 
limiting and a richer knowledge source is required to assign 
accent patterns to complex nominals (see [<SPAN
CLASS="CITATION"
>sproat90}</SPAN
>]. </P
><P
>However all these techniques quickly come to the stumbling block 
that although simple so-called discourse neutral intonation is 
relatively easy achieve, achieving realistic, natural accent 
placement is still beyond our synthesis systems (though perhaps 
not for much longer). </P
><P
>The simplest rule for English may be reasonable for other 
languages. There are even simpler solutions to this, such 
as fixed prosody, or fixed declination, but apart from 
debugging a voice these are simpler than is required even 
for the most basic voices. </P
><P
>For English, adding a simple hat accent on lexically stressed syllables 
in all content words works surprisingly well. To do this in Festival you 
need a CART tree to predict accentedness, and rules to add the hat 
accent (though we will leave out F0 generation until the next section). </P
><P
>A basic tree that predicts accents of stressed syllables 
in content words is

The above tree simply distinguishes accented syllables from 
non-accented. In theories like ToBI [<SPAN
CLASS="CITATION"
>silverman92</SPAN
>], a number of 
different types of accent are supported. ToBI, with variations, has been 
applied to a number of languages and may be suitable for yours. 
However, although accent and boundary types have been identified for 
various languages and dialects, a computational mechanism for generating 
and F0 contour from an accent specification often has not yet been 
specified (we will discuss this more fully below). </P
><P
>If the above is considered too naive a more elaborate hand specified 
tree can also be written, using relevant factors, probably similar to 
those used in [<SPAN
CLASS="CITATION"
>hirschberg90</SPAN
>]. Following that, training from 
data is the next option. Assuming a database exists and has been 
labeled with discrete accent classifications, we can extract 
data from it for training a CART tree with <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>wagon</TT
>. We will 
build the tree in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>festival/accents/</TT
>. First we need 
a file listing the features that are felt to affect accenting. 
For this we will predict accents on syllables as that has been 
used for the English voices created so far, but there is an 
argument for predict accent placement on a word basis as although 
accents will need to be syllable aligned, which syllable in a 
word gets the accent is reasonably well defined (at least compared 
with predicting accent placement). </P

if takes an range of values you must hand edit the output 
file and change any feature to <CODE

Deciding on a stop value for training depends on the number of 
examples, though this can be tuned to ensure over-training isn't 
happening.

>This above is designed to predict accents, and similar tree should be 
used to predict boundary tones as well. For the most part intonation 
boundaries are defined to occur at prosodic phrase boundaries so that 
task is somewhat easier, though if you have a number of boundary tone 
types in your inventory then the prediction is not so straightforward. </P

When training ToBI type accent types it is not easy to get the right 
type of variation in the accent types. Although some ToBI labels have 
been associated with semantic intentions and including discourse 
information has been shown help prediction (e.g. [<SPAN
CLASS="CITATION"
>black97a}</SPAN
>], 
getting this acceptably correct is not easy. Various techniques 
in modifying the training data do seem to help. Because of the 
low incidence of <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>L*</I
>"</SPAN
> labels in at least the f2b data, 
duplicating all sample points in the training data with L's 
does increase the likelihood of prediction and does seem to give 
a more varied distribution. Alternatively wagon returns a 
probability distribution for the accents, normally the most 
probable is selected, this could be modified to select from 
the distribution randomly based on their probabilities. </P
