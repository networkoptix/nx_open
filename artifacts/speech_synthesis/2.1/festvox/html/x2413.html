Labeling nonsense words is <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>much</I
> easier than labeling continuous 
speech, whether it is by hand or automatically. With nonsense words, it 
is completely defined which phones are there and they are (hopefully) 
clearly articulated. </P
><P
>&#13;We have had significant experience in hand labeling diphones, and with 
the right tools it can be done fairly quickly (e.g. 20 hours for 2500 
nonsense words) even if it is a mind-numbing exercise which your voice 
talent may offer you little sympathy for after you've made them babble 
for hours in a box with electrodes on their throat (optional). But 
labeling can't realistically be done for more than an hour or two at 
any one time. As a minimum, the start of the preceding phone to the 
first phone in the diphone, the changeover, and the end of the second 
phone in the diphone should be labeled. Note we recommend phone 
boundary labeling as that is much better defined than phone middle 
marking. The diphone will, by default be extracted from the middle of 
phone one to the middle of phone two. </P
><P
>&#13;
Your data set conventions may include the labeling of closures within 
stops explicitly. Thus you would expect the label <CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>tcl</CODE
> at the end 
of the silence part of a /t/ and a label <CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>t</CODE
> after the burst. This 
way the diphone boundary can automatically be placed within the silence 
part of the stop. The label <CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>DB</CODE
> can be used when explicit diphone 
boundaries are desireable; this is useful within phones such as 
diphthongs where the temporal middle need not be the most stable part. </P
><P
>&#13;Another place when specific diphone boundaries are recommended is in the 
phone-to-silence diphones. The phones at the end of words are typically 
longer than word internal phones, and tend to trail off in energy. Thus 
the midpoint of a phone immediately before a silence typically has much 
less energy than the midpoint of a word internal phone. Thus, when a 
diphone is to be concatenated to a phone-silence diphone, there would be 
a big jump in energy (as well as other related spectral characteristics). 
Our solution to this is explicitly label a diphone boundary near the 
beginning of the phone before the silence (about 20% in) where the 
energy is much closer to what it will be in the diphone that will 
precede it. </P
><P
>If you are using explicit closures, it is worth noting that stops at the 
start of words don't seem to have a closure part; however it is a good 
idea to actually label one anyway, if you are doing this by hand. Just 
"steal" a suitable short piece of silence from the preceding part of the 
waveform. </P
><P
>&#13;Because the words will often have very varying amounts of silence around 
them, it is a good idea to label multiple silences around the word, so 
that the silence immediately before the first phone is about 200-300 ms, 
and labeling the silence before that as another phone; likewise with 
the final silence. Also, as the final phone before the end silence may 
trail off, we recommend that the end of the last phone come at the very 
end of any signal thus appear to include silence within it. Then label 
the real silence (200-300 ms) after it. The reason for this is if the 
end silence happens to include some part of the spoken signal, and if 
this is duplicated, as is the case when duration is elongated, an 
audible buzz can be introduced. </P
><P
>&#13;
Because labeling of diphone nonsense words is such a constrained task 
we have included a program for automatically providing a labeling for 
the spoken prompts. This requires that prompts be generated for the 
diphone database. The aligner uses those prompts to do the aligning. 
Though its not actually necessary that the prompts were used as prompts 
they do need to be generated for this alignment process. This is not the 
only means for alignment; you may also, for instance, use a speech 
recognizer, such as CMU Sphinx, to segment (align) the data. </P
><P
>The idea behind the aligner is to take the prompt and the spoken form 
and derive mel-scale cepstral parameterizations (and their deltas) of 
the files. Then a DTW (dynamic time warping) algorithm is used to find 
the best alignment between these two sets of features. Then the prompt 
label file is used to index through the alignment to give a label file 
for the spoken nonsense word. This is largely based on the techniques 
described in [<SPAN
CLASS="CITATION"
>malfrere97</SPAN
>], though this general technique has been 
used for many years. </P
><P
>We have tested this aligner on a number of existing hand-labeled 
databases to compare the quality of the alignments with respect to 
the hand labeling. We have also tested aligning prompts generated 
from a language different from that being recorded. To do this there 
needs to be reasonable mapping between the language phonesets. </P
><P
>Here are results for automatically finding labels for 
the ked (US English) by aligning them against prompts generated by 
three different voices

Note that gsw actually gives better results than mwm, even though it is 
a different dialect of English. We built three diphone index files from 
each of the label sets generated from there alignment processes. 
ked-to-ked was the best, and only marginally worse that the database 
made from the manually produced labels. The database from mwm and gsw 
produced labels were a little worse but not unacceptably so. 
Considering a significant amount of careful corrections were made to the 
manually produced labels, these automatically produced labels are still 
significantly better than the first pass of hand labels. </P
><P
>A further experiment was made across languages; the ked diphones were 
used as prompts to align a set of Korean diphones. Even though there 
are a number of phones in Korean not present in English (various forms 
of aspirated consonants), the results are quite usable. </P
><P
>Whether you use hand labeling or automatic alignment, it is always 
worthwhile doing some hand-correction after the basic database is built. 
Mistakes (sometimes systematic) always occur and listening to 
substantial subset of the diphones (or them all if you resynthesize the 
nonsense words) is definitely worth the time in finding bad diphones. 
The diva is in the details. </P

The script is written so it may be use used in parallel on multiple 
machines if you want to distribute the process. On a Pentium Pro 
200MHz, which you probably won't be able to find any more, a 2000 word 
diphone databases can be labeled in about 30 minutes. Most of that 
time is in generating the cepstrum coefficients. This is down to a 
few minutes at most on a dual Pentium III 550. </P
><P
>&#13;Once the nonsense words have been labeled, you need to build a diphone 
index. The index identifies which diphone comes from which files, and 
from where. This can be automatically built from the label files 
(mostly). The Festival script 
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>festvox/src/diphones/make_diph_index</TT
> will take the diphone list 
(as used above), find the occurrence of each diphone in the label files, 
and build an index. The index consists of a simple header, followed by 
a single line for each diphone: the diphone name, the fileid, start time, 
mid-point (i.e. the phone boundary) and end time. The times are given 
in <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>seconds</I
> (note that early versions of Festival, using a different 
diphone synthesizer module, used milliseconds for this. If you have 
such an old version of Festival, it's time to update it). </P

You should check that this has successfully found all the named 
diphones. When an diphone is not found in a label file, an entry with 
zeroes for the start, middle, and end is generated, which will produce a 
warning when being used in Festival, but it is worth checking in 
advance. </P

>. It will also automatically remove underscores and 
dollar symbols from the diphone names before searching for the diphone 
in the label file, and it will only find the first occurrence of the 
diphone. </P
