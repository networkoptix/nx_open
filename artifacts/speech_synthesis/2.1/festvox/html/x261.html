The basic building block for Festival is the <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>utterance</I
>. The 
structure consists of a set of <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>relations</I
> over a set of 
<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>items</I
>. Each item represents a object such as a word, segment, 
syllable, etc. while relations relate these items together. An item may 
appear in multiple relations, such as a segment will be in a 
<CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>Segment</CODE
> relation and also in the <CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>SylStructure</CODE
> relation. 
Relations define an ordered structure over the items within them, in 
general these may be arbitrary graphs but in practice so far we have 
only used <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>lists</I
> and <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>trees</I
> Items may contain a number of 
features. </P
><P
>There are no built-in relations in Festival and the names and use of 
them is controlled by the particular modules used to do synthesis. 
Language, voice and module specific relations can easy be created and 
manipulated. However within our basic voices we have followed a number 
of conventions that should be followed if you wish to use some of the 
existing modules. </P
><P
>&#13;The relation names used will depend on the particular structure chosen 
for your voice. So far most of our released voices have the same 
basic structure though some of our research voices contain quite 
a different set of relations. For our basic English voices the 
relations used are as follows

><DD
><P
>&#13;A list of trees where each root of each tree is the white space 
separated tokenized object from the input character string. Punctuation 
and whitespace has been stripped and placed on features on these token 
items. The daughters of each of these roots are the list of words 
that the token is associated with. In many cases this is a one 
to one relationship, but in general it is one to zero or 
more. For example tokens comprising of digits will typically 
be associated with a number of words. </P

The words in the utterance. By <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>word</I
> we typically mean something 
that can be given a pronunciation from a lexicon (or letter-to-sound 
rules). However in most of our voices we distinguish pronunciation by 
the words and a part of speech feature. Words with also be leaves of the 
<CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>Token</CODE
> relation, leaves of the <CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>Phrase</CODE
> relation and roots of 
the <CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>SylStructure</CODE
> relation. </P
></DD
><DT
><CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>Phrase</CODE
></DT
><DD
><P
>&#13;A simple list of trees representing the prosodic phrasing on the 
utterance. In our voices we only have one level of prosodic phrase 
below the utterance (though you can easily add a deeper hierarchy 
if your models require it). The tree roots are labeled with 
the phrase type and the leaves of these trees are in the 
<CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>Word</CODE
> relation. </P
></DD
><DT
><CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"

nodes in the <CODE

these syllables are in and the segments that are in these syllables. 
In this format no further onset/coda distinction is made explicit but can 
be derived from this information. </P

segment is placed within its syllable and word. By convention 
silence phones do not appear in any syllable (or word) but will 
exist in the segment relation. </P
