Festival, in its publically distributed form, currently only supports 
residual excited Linear-Predictive Coding (LPC) resynthesis 
[<SPAN
CLASS="CITATION"
>hunt89</SPAN
>]. It does support PSOLA [<SPAN
CLASS="CITATION"
>moulines90</SPAN
>], though this is 
not distributed in the public version. Both of these techniques are 
<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>pitch synchronous</I
>, that is there require information about where 
pitch periods occur in the acoustic signal. Where possible, it is 
better to record with an electroglottograph (EGG, also known as a 
laryngograph) at the same time as the voice signal. The EGG records 
electrical activity in the glottis during speech, which makes it easier 
to get the pitch moments, and so they can be more precisely found. </P
><P
>Although extracting pitch periods from the EGG signal is not trivial, it 
is fairly straightforward in practice, as The Edinburgh Speech Tools 
include a program <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>pitchmark</TT
> which will process the EGG signal 
giving a set of pitchmarks. However it is not fully automatic and 
requires someone to look at the result and make some decisions to change 
parameters that may improve the result. </P
><P
>The first major issue in processing the signal is deciding which way is 
up. From our experience, we have seen the signal inverted in some cases 
and it is necessary to identify the direction in order for the rest of 
the processing to work properly. In general we've found the CSTR's LAR 
output is upside down while OGI's and CMU's output is the right way up, 
though this can even flip from file to file. If you find inverted 
signals, you should add <CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>-inv</CODE
> to the arguments to 
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>pitchmark</TT
>. </P
><P
>The object is to produce a single mark at the peak of each pitch period and 
"fake" or "phantom" periods during unvoiced regions. The basic command 
we have found that works for us is

It is worth doing one or two by hand and confirming that a reasonable 
pitch periods are found. Note that the <CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>-min</CODE
> and <CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>-max</CODE
> 
arguments are speaker-dependent. This can be moved towards the fixed F0 
point used in the prompts, though remember the speaker will not have 
been exactly constant. The script <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>festvox/src/general/make_pm</TT
> 
can be copied and modified (for the particular pitch range) and run to 
generate the pitchmarks

If you don't have an EGG signal for your diphones, the alternative is to 
extract the pitch periods using some other signal processing function. 
Finding the pitch periods is similar to finding the F0 contour and, 
although harder than finding it from the EGG signal, with clean 
laboratory-recorded speech, such as diphones, it is possible. The 
following script is a modification of the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>make_pm</TT
> script above 
for extracting pitchmarks from a raw waveform signal. It is not as good 
as extracting from the EGG file, but it works. It is more 
computationally intensive, as it requires rather high order filters. 
The value should change depending on the speaker's pitch range.

If you are extracting pitch periods automatically, it is worth taking 
more care to check the signal. We have found that recording consistency 
and bad pitch extraction the two most common causes of poor quality 
synthesis. </P
