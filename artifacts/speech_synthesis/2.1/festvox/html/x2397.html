>&#13;The object of recording diphones is to get as uniform a set of 
pronunciations as possible. Your speaker should be relaxed, not be 
suffering for a cold, or cough, or a hangover. If something goes wrong 
with the recording and some of the examples need to be re-recorded it is 
important that the speaker has as similar a voice as with the original 
recording, waiting for another cold to come along is not reasonable, 
(though some may argue that the same hangover can easily be induced). 
Also to try to keep the voice potentially repeatable it is wise to 
record at the same time of day, morning is a good idea. The points 
on speaker selection and recording in the previous section should also 
be borne in mind. </P
><P
>The recording environment should be reconstructable, so that the 
conditions can be set up again if needed. Everything should be as 
well-defined as possible, as far as gain settings, microphone distances, 
and so on. Anechoic chambers are best, but general recording studios 
will do. We've even done recording in an open room, with care this 
works (make sure there's little background noise from computers, air 
conditioning, outside traffic etc). Of course open rooms aren't ideal 
but they are better than open noisey rooms. </P
><P
>The distance between the speaker and the microphone is crucial. A head 
mounted mike helps keep this constant; the Shure SM-2 headset, for 
instance, works well with the mic positioned at 8mm from the lips or so. 
This can be checked with a ruler. Considering the cost and availability 
of headmounted microphones and rulers, you should really consider using 
them. While even fixed microphones like the Shure SM-57 can be used 
well by professional voice talent, we strongly recommend a good headset 
mic. </P

>Ultimately, you need to split the recordings into individual files, one 
for each prompt. Ideally this can be done while recording on a 
file-by-file basis, but as that may not be practical and some other 
technique can be used, such as recording onto DAT and transferring the 
data to disk (and downsampling) later. Files might contain 50-100 
nonsense words each. In this case we hand label the words, taking into 
account any duplicates caused be errors in the recording. The program 
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>ch_wave</TT
> in the Edinburgh Speech Tools (EST) offers a function to 
split a large file into individual files based on a label file. We can 
use this to get our individual files. You may also add an identifiable 
noise during recording and automatically detect that as a split point, 
as is often done at the Oregon Graduate Instititute.. They typically 
use two different noises that can easily be distinguished and use one 
for <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>OK</I
>"</SPAN
> and <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>BAD</I
>"</SPAN
> this can make the splitting of the files 
into the individual nonsense words easier. Note you will also need 
to split the electroglottograph (EGG) signal exactly the same way, if 
you are using one. </P
><P
>No matter how you split these, you should be aware that there will still 
often be mistakes, and checking by listening will help. </P
><P
>We now almost always record directly to disk on a computer using a
sound card; see <A
HREF="x817.html"
>the Section called <I
>Recording under Unix</I
> in the Chapter called <I
>Basic Requirements</I
></A
> for recording
setup details. There can be a reduction in the quality of the
recording due to poor quality audio hardware in computers (and often
too much noise), though at least the hardware issue is getting to be
less of a problem these days. There are lots of advantages to
recording directly to disk, as the stage of digitising, transfering
and spliting the offline records is laborious and prone to error.</P
