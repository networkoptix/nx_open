>A Japanese Diphone Voice</H1
><P
>In this chapter we work through a full example of creating a 
voice given that most of the basic construction work (model 
building) has been done. Pariticularly this discusses the scheme 
files, and conventions for keeping a voices together and how 
you can go about packaging it for general use. </P
><P
>Ultimately a voice in Festival will consist of a diphone database, a 
lexicon (and lts rules) and a number of scheme files that offer the 
complete voice. When people other than the developer of a voice wish to 
use your newly developed voice it is only that small set of files that 
are required and need to be distributed (freely or otherwise). By convention 
we have distributed diphone group files, a single file holding the index, 
and diphone data itself, and a set scheme files that describe the voice 
(and its necessary models). </P
><P
>Basic skeleton files are included in the festvox distribution. 
If you are unsure how to go about building the basic files it 
is recommended you follow this schema and modify these to your 
particular needs. </P
><P
>By convention a voice name consist of an institution name (like 
<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>cmu</I
>, <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>cstr</I
>, etc), if you don't have an insitution 
just use <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>net</I
>. Second you need to identify the language, 
there is an ISO two letter standard for it fails to distinguish 
dialects (such as US and UK English) so it need not be strictly 
followed. However a short identifier for the language is probably 
prefered. Third you identify the speaker, we have typically used 
three letter initials which are the initials of the person speaker but 
any name is reasonable. If you are going to build a US or UK English 
voice you should look <A

language has been defined, and it is wise to follow convention when it 
exists. Note that the default phonetic features in the skeleton file 
may need to be modified for other languages. For Japanese, there are 
standards and here we use a set similar to the ATR phoneset used by many 
in Japan for speech processing. (This file is included, but <I

In addition to generating the diphone schema the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>ja_schema.scm</TT
> 
also should provied the functions <CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>Diphone_Prompt_Setup</CODE
>, which 
is called before generating the prompts, and <CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>Diphone_Prompt_Word</CODE
>, 
which is called before waveform synthesis of each nonsense word. </P
><P
><CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>Diphone_Prompt_Setup</CODE
>, should be used to select a speaker to 
generate the prompts. Note even though you may not use the prompts when 
recording they are necessary for labeling the spoken speech, so you 
still need to generate them. If you haeva synthesizer already int eh 
language use ti to generate the prompts (assuming you can get it to 
generate from phone lists also generate label files). Often the MBROLA 
project already has a waveform synthesizer for the language so you can 
use that. In this case we are going to use a US English voice 
(kal_diphone) to generate the prompts. For Japanese that's probably ok 
as the Japanese phoneset is (mostly) a subset of the English phoneset, 
though using the generated prompts to prompt the user is probably not a 
good idea. </P
><P
>The second function <CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>Diphone_Prompt_Word</CODE
>, is used to map the 
Japanese phone set to the US English phone set so that waveform 
synthesis will work. In this case a simple map of Japanese phone 
to one or more English phones is given and the code simple 
changes the phone name in the segment relation (and adds a new 
new segment in the multi-phone case). </P

Occasionally when you are building the prompts some diphones requested 
in the prompt voice don't actually exists (especially when you are 
doing cross-language prompting). Thus the generated prompt has some 
default diphone (typically silence-silence added). This is mostly 
ok, as long as its not happening multiple times in the same nonsence 
word. The speaker just should be aware that some prompts aren't actually 
correct (which of course is going to be true for all prompts in the 
cross-language prompting case). </P

automatically. To do this you should add a symbolic link

festival's voice directory (this will vary depending on where your 
version of festival is installed)
