></H1

> 
For many languages there is a systematic relationship between the
written form of a word and its pronunciation. For some languages this
can be fairly easy to write down, by hand. In Festival there is a
letter to sound rule system that allows rules to be written, but we
also provided a method for building rule sets automatically which will
often be more useful.  The choice of using hand-written or
automatically trained rules depends on the language you are dealing
with and the relationship it has between its orthography and its phone
set.</P
><P
>For well defined languages like Spanish and Croatian writting rules by
hand can be more simple than training.  Training requires an existing
set of lexical entries to train from and that may be your decision
criteria.  Hand written letter to sound rules are context dependent
re-write rules which are applied in sequence mapping strings letters
to string of phones (though the system does not explicitly care what
the types of the strings actually will be used for.</P
><P
>The basic form of the rules is
<A
NAME="AEN1438"
></A
><BLOCKQUOTE
CLASS="BLOCKQUOTE"
><P
CLASS="LITERALLAYOUT"
>(&nbsp;LC&nbsp;[&nbsp;alpha&nbsp;]&nbsp;RC&nbsp;=&#62;&nbsp;beta&nbsp;)</P
></BLOCKQUOTE
>
Which is interpreter as <CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>alpha</CODE
>, a string
of one or more symbols on the input tape is written to 
<CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>beta</CODE
>, a string of zero or more symbols on
the output tape, when in the presence of <CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>LC</CODE
>,
a left context of zero or more input symbols, and <CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>RC</CODE
>
a right context on zero or more input symbols.  Note the input
tape and the output tape are different, allthough the input and
output alphabets need not be distinct the left hand
side of a rule only can refer to the input tape and never to anything
that has been produce by a right hand side.  Thus 
rules within a ruleset cannot "feed" or "bleed" themselves.  It is
possible to cascade multiple rule sets, but we will discuss that
below.</P
><P
>For example to desl with the pronunciation of the letters "ch" 
word initially in English we may right two rules like this
<A
NAME="AEN1445"
></A
><BLOCKQUOTE
CLASS="BLOCKQUOTE"
><P
CLASS="LITERALLAYOUT"
>(&nbsp;#&nbsp;[&nbsp;c&nbsp;h&nbsp;]&nbsp;r&nbsp;=&#62;&nbsp;k&nbsp;)<br>
(&nbsp;#&nbsp;[&nbsp;c&nbsp;h&nbsp;]&nbsp;=&#62;&nbsp;ch&nbsp;)</P
></BLOCKQUOTE
>
To deal with words like "christmas", and "chair".  Note the
<CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>#</CODE
> symbol is special and used to denote
a word boundary.  LTS rule may refer to word boundary but cannot refer
to prevous or following words, you would need to do this with
some form of post-lexical rule (See <A
HREF="x1615.html"
>the Section called <I
>Post-lexical rules</I
></A
>)
where the word is within some context.  In the above rules we are
mapping <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>two</I
> letters <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>c</I
>
and <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>h</I
> to a single phone <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>k</I
>
or <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>ch</I
>.  Also note the order of these rules.
The first rule is more specific than the second.  This is should
appear first to deal with the specific case.  In the order were
reversed <CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>k</CODE
> could never apply as the <CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>ch</CODE
>
would cover that case too.</P
><P
>Thus LTS rules should be written with the most specific cases first
and typically end in a default case.  Their should be a default
case for all individual letters in the language's alphabet without
and context restrictions mapping to some default phone.  Therefore
following the above rules there would be other <CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>c</CODE
>
rules with various contexts but the final one should probably be
<A
NAME="AEN1458"
></A

><P
>As it is a common error in writting these rules, it is worth
repeating.  If a rule set is to be universally applicable
<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>all</I
> letters in the input alphabet must have at a
rule mapping them to some phone.</P
><P
>The section to be mapped (within square brackets) and the section it
is mapped into (after the "=&#62;") must be items in the input and output
alphabets and may not include sets or regular expression operators.
This does mean more rules need to be explicitly written than you
might like, but that will also help you not forget some rules
that are required.</P
><P
>For some languages it is conveninet to write a number of rules sets.
For example, one to map the input in lower case, and maybe deal with
alternate treatments of accent characters e.g. re-write the ASCII "e'"
as <SPAN
CLASS="COMMENT"
>AWB: e acute</SPAN
>.  Also we have used rule tests to
post process the generated phone string to add stress and syllable
breaks.</P
><P
>Finally some people have stressed that writing good letter to sound
rules is hard.  We would disagree with this, from our experience
writing good letter to sound rules by hand is
<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>very</I
> hard and <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>very</I
> skilled
and <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>very</I
> laborious.  For anything but the
simplest of languages writting rules by hand requires much more
time that people typically have, and will still contain errors (even
with an exception list).  However hand rules sets may be ideal
in some circumstances.</P
