>Text analysis</H1
><P
>This chapter discusses some of the basic problems in analyzing text
when trying to convert it to speech.  Although it is oftain considered
a trival problem, not worthy of specnding time one, to anyone who has
to actually listen to general text-to-speech systems quickly realises
it is not as easy to pronounce text as it first appears.  Numbers,
symbols, acronyms, abbreviations apear to various degrees in different
types of text, even the most general types, like news stoires and
novels still have tokens which do not have a simple pronunciaiton that
can be found merely by looking up the token in a lexicon, or using
letter to sound rules.</P
><P
>In any new language, or any new domain that you wish to tranfer text
to speech building an apporpriate text analysis module is necessary.
As an attempt to define what we mean by text analysis more
specifically we will consider this module as taking in strings of
characters and producing strings of <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>words</I
> where
we defined words to be items for which a lexicon can provide
pronucniations either by direct lookup or by some form of letter to
sound rules.</P
><P
>The degree of difficult of this convertion task depends on the text
type and language.  For example in lanmguages like Chinese, Japanese
etc., there is, conventionally, no use of whitespace characaters
between words as found in most Western language, thus even identfying
the token boundaries is an interesting task.  Even in English text the
proportion of simple pronouncable words to what we will term
<I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>non-standard words</I
> can vary greatly.  We define
non-standard words (NSWs) to be those tokens which do not apear
directly in the lexicon (at least as a first simplication).  Thus
tokens contains digits, abbreviations, and out of vocabulary words are
all considered to be NSWs that require some form of identification
before their pronunciation can be specified.  Sometimes NSWs are
ambiguous and some (often shallow) level of analysis is necessary
to identfiy them.  For example in English the string of
digits <SAMP
CLASS="COMPUTEROUTPUT"
>1996</SAMP
> can have several
different pronunciations depending on its use.  If it is used
as a year it is pronunciation as <SAMP
CLASS="COMPUTEROUTPUT"
>nineteen ninety-six</SAMP
>, if it is a quantity it is more likely pronuounced
as <SAMP
CLASS="COMPUTEROUTPUT"
>one thousand nine hundred (and) ninety-six</SAMP
> while if it is used as a telephone extention it
can be pronounced simpelas a string of digits <SAMP
CLASS="COMPUTEROUTPUT"
>one nine nine six </SAMP
>.  Deterimining the appropriate
type of expansion is the job of the text analysis module.</P
><P
>Much of this chapter is based on a project that was carried out at a
summer workshop at Johns Hopkins University in 1999
[<SPAN
CLASS="CITATION"
>JHU-NSW-99</SPAN
>] and later published in
[<SPAN
CLASS="CITATION"
>Sproat00</SPAN
>], the tools and techniques developed at
that workshop were further developed and documented and now
distributed as part of the FestVox project.  After a discussion of the
problem in more detail, concentrating on English examples, a full
presentation of NSW text analysis technique will be given with a
simple example. After that we will address different appropaches that
can be taken in Festival to build general and customized text analysis
models.  Then we will address a number of specifc problems that
appear in text analysis in various languages including homogra[h
disambiguation, number pronunciation in Slavic languages, and 
segmentation in Chinese.</P

>In an attempt to avoid relying solely on a bunch of "hacky" rules, we
can better define the task of analyzing text using a number of
statistical trained models using either labeled or unlabeled text
from the desired domain.  At first approximation it may seem to be a
trival problem, but the number of non-standard words is enough even in
what is considered clean text such as press wire news articales to
make their synthesis sound bad without it.</P
