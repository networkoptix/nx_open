This program filters in incoming waveform (with a low and a high band 
filter, then uses autocorellation to find the pitch mark peaks with the 
min and max specified. Finally it fills in the unvoiced section with 
the default pitchmarks. </P
><P
>For debugging purposes you should remove the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>-fill</TT
> option 
so you can see where it is finding pitchmarks. Next you should modify 
the min and max values to fit the range of your speaker. The defaults 
here (0.005 and 0.012) are for a male speaker in about the range 200 to 
80 Hz. For a female you probably want values about 0.0033 and 0.7 
(300Mhz to 140Hz). </P

This should should a number of pitchmarks over the voiced 
sections of speech. If there are none, or very few it definitely 
means the parameters are wrong. For example the above parameters 
on this file <CODE

>taataataa</CODE
> properly find pitchmarks in the three vowel 
sections

It the high and low pass filter values <CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>-lx_lf 200 -lx_hf 80</CODE
> 
are in appropriate for the speakers pitch range you may get either 
too many, or two few pitch marks. For example if we change the 
200 to 60, we find only two pitch marks in the third vowel.

The pitch marks should be aligned to the largest (above zero) 
peak in each pitch period. Here we can see there are too many pitchmarks 
(effectively twice as many). The pitchmarks at 0.617, 0.628, 0.639 and 
0.650 are extraneous. This means our pitch range is too wide. If 
we rerun changing the min size, and the low frequency filter

Which is better but its now missing pitchmarks towards the end of 
the vowel, at 0.634, 0.644 and 0.656. Giving more range 
for the min (0.005) gives slight better results, but still we 
get bad pitchmarks. The double pitch mark problem can be lessened by 
not only changing the range but also the amount order of the high 
and low pass filters (effectively allowing more smoothing). Thus 
when secondary pitchmarks appear increasing the <CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>-lx_lo</CODE
> parameter 
often helps

This is satisfactory this file and probably for the whole databases of 
that speaker. Though it is worth checking a few other files to get he best 
results. Note the by increasing the order of the filer the pitchmark 
creep forward (which is bad). </P

>If you feel brave (or are desperate) you can actually edit the 
pitchmarks yourself with emulabel. We have done this occasionally 
especially when we find persistent synthesis errors (spikes etc).

get pitchmarks out of wave signals. These require more work to offer a 
more reliable solution, which we know exists. Extracting (fixed 
frame) LPC coefficients and extracting a residual, then extracting 
pitchmarks could give a more reliable solution but although all these 
tools are available we have not experimented with that yet. </P
