It is very important that your speaker and you understand the legal 
status of the recorded database. It is very wise that the speaker 
signs a statement before you start recording or at least talk to them 
ensuring they understand what you want to do with the data and what 
restrictions if any they require. Remember in recording their 
voice you are potentially allowing anyone (who gets access to the 
database) to fake that person's voice. The whole issue of 
building a synthetic voice from recordings is still actually an 
uninvestigated part of copyright but there are clear ways to ensure you 
wont be caught out by a law suit, or a disgruntled subject later. </P
><P
>Explain what you going to do with the database. Get the speaker 
to agree to the level use you may make of the recordings (and any 
use of them). This will roughly be: 
<P
></P
><UL
><LI
STYLE="list-style-type: disc"
><P
>free for any use</P
></LI
><LI
STYLE="list-style-type: disc"
><P
>free to distribute to anyone but cannot be used for commercial purposes without further contract.</P
></LI
><LI
STYLE="list-style-type: disc"
><P
>research use only (does this allow public demos?)</P
></LI
><LI
STYLE="list-style-type: disc"
><P
>fully proprietary</P
></LI
></UL
>
You must find out what the speaker agrees to before you start spending 
your time recording. There is nothing worse than spending weeks 
on building a good voice only to discover that you don't have rights 
to do anything with it. </P
><P
>Also, don't lie to the speaker make it clear, what it means if their 
voice is to be released for free. If you release the voice on the net 
(as we do with our voices), <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>anyone</I
> may use it. It could be used 
anywhere, from reading porn stories to emergency broadcast systems. 
Also note that effectively building a voice from a synthesizer means 
that the person will no longer be able to use voice id systems as a 
password protection (actually that depends on the type of voice id 
system). However also reassure them that these extremes are very 
unlikely and actually they will be contributing to world of speech 
science and people will use their voice because they like it. </P
><P
>We (KAL and AWB) have already given up the idea that our voices are in
anyway ours and have recorded databases and made them public (even
though AWB has a funny accent). When recording others we ensure they
understand the consequences and get them to explicitly sign a license that 
gives us (and/or our institution) the rights to do anything they wish,
but the intention is the voice will be released for free without
restriction. From our point of view, having no restrictions is by far
the easiest. We also give (non-exclusive) commercial rights to the
voice to the speaker themselves. This actually costs us nothing, and
given most of our recorded voices are for free the speaker could
re-release the free version and use it commercially (as can anyone
else) but its nice that the original license allows the speaker direct
commercial rights (none that I know of have actually done anything
with those rights).</P
><P
>There may be other factors though. Someone else may be paying for the 
database so they need to be accommodated on any such license. Also a 
database may already be recorded under some license and you wish to use 
it to build a synthetic voice, make sure you have the rights to do this. 
Its amazing how mainly people record speech databases and don't take 
into account the fact that someone else may build a general TTS systems 
from their voice. Its better that you check that have to deal with 
problems later. </P
><P
>An example of the license we use at CMU is given in the festvox 
distribution <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>festvox/src/vox_files/speaker.licence</TT
>. </P
><P
>Also note that there are legal aspects to other parts of a synthetic 
voice the builder must also ensure they have rights to. Lexicons may 
have various restrictions. The Oxford Advanced Learners' Dictionary 
that we currently use for UK English voices is free for non-commercial 
use only, thus effectively imposing the same restriction on the complete 
voice even though the prosodic models and diphone databases are free. 
Also be careful you check the rights when building models from existing 
data. Some databases are free for research only and even data derived 
from them (e.g. duration models) may not be further distributed. Check 
at the start, question all pieces of the system to make sure you know 
who owns what and what restrictions they impose. This process is worth 
doing at the start of a project so things are always clear. </P
