>Festival's Scheme Programming Language</H1
><P
>This chapter acts as a reference guide for the particular dialect of 
the Scheme programming language used in the Festival Speech Synthesis 
systems. The Scheme programming language is a dialect of Lisp 
designed to be more consistent. It was chosen for the basic 
scripting language in Festival because: 
<P

STYLE="list-style-type: disc"

>&#13;it is a very easy language for machines to parse and interpret, thus 
the foot print for the interpreter proper is very small </P

Having a scripting language in Festival is actually one of the 
fundamental properties that makes Festival a useful system. The fact 
that new voices and languages in many cases can be added without 
changing the underlying C++ code makes the system mouch more powerful 
and accessible than a more monolithic system that requires recompilation 
for any parameter changes. As there is sometimes confusion we 
should make it clear that Festival contains its own Scheme interpreter 
as part of the system. Festival can be view as a Scheme interpreter 
that has had basic addition to its function to include modules 
that can do speech synthesis, no external Scheme interperter is 
required to use Festival. </P
><P
>The actual interpreter used in Festival is based on George Carret's 
SIOD, "Scheme in one Defun". But this has been substantially enhanced 
from its small elegant beginnings into something that might be better 
called "Scheme in one directory". Although there is a standard for 
Scheme the version in Festival does not fully follow it, for both good 
and bad reasons. Thus finding in order for people to be able to program 
in Festival's Scheme we provide this chapter to list the core type, 
functions, etc and some examples. We do not pretend to be teaching 
programming here but as we know many people who are interested in 
building voices are not primarily programmers, some guidance on the 
language and its usage will make the simple programming that is 
required in building voices, more accessible. </P
><P
>For reference the Scheme Revised Revised Revised report describes the 
standard definition [<SPAN
CLASS="CITATION"
>srrrr90</SPAN
>]. For a good introduction to 
programming in general that happens to use Scheme as its example 
language we recommend [<SPAN
CLASS="CITATION"
>abelson85</SPAN
>]. Also for those who are 
unfamiliar with the use of Lisp-like scripting languages we recommend a 
close look as GNU Emacs which uses Lisp as its underlying scripting 
language, knowledge of the internals of Emacs did to some extent 
influence the scripting language design of Festival. </P

>"Lots of brackets" is what comes to most people's minds when considering 
Lisp and its various derivatives such as Scheme. At the start this can 
seem daunting and it is true that parenthesis errors can cuase problems. 
But with an editor that does proper bracket matching, brackets can 
actually be helpful in code structure rather than a hindrance. </P
><P
>The fundamental structure is the <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>s-expression</I
>. It consists of an 
atom, or a list of s-expressions. This simply defined recursive 
structure allows complex structures to easily be specified. For 
example 
<A
NAME="AEN3814"
></A
><BLOCKQUOTE
CLASS="BLOCKQUOTE"
><P
CLASS="LITERALLAYOUT"
>3<br>
(1&nbsp;2&nbsp;3)<br>
(a&nbsp;(b&nbsp;c)&nbsp;d)<br>
((a&nbsp;b)&nbsp;(d&nbsp;e))</P
></BLOCKQUOTE
>
Unlike other programming languages Scheme's data and code are 
in the same format, s-expressions. Thus s-expression 
are evaluated, recursively.

Thus the s-expression 
<A
NAME="AEN3832"
></A
><BLOCKQUOTE
CLASS="BLOCKQUOTE"
><P
CLASS="LITERALLAYOUT"
>(+&nbsp;1&nbsp;2)</P
></BLOCKQUOTE

>3</CODE

is bound to a function that adds it arguments. </P
><P
>Variables may be set using the <CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>set!</CODE

a variable name and a value as arguments 
<A
NAME="AEN3838"
></A
><BLOCKQUOTE
CLASS="BLOCKQUOTE"
><P
CLASS="LITERALLAYOUT"
>(set!&nbsp;a&nbsp;3)</P
></BLOCKQUOTE
>
The <CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>set!</CODE
> function is unusual in that it does not evaluate its 
first argument. If it did you have to explcitly quote it or set some 
other variable to have a value of <CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>a</CODE
> to get the desired effect. </P
