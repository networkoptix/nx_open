>University of
Edinburgh</A
> in the late 90's.  It offers a free, portable,
language independent, run-time speech synthesis engine for verious
platforms under various APIs.  This book is not about the Festival
system itself, Festival is just the engine that we will use in the
process of building voices, both as a run-time engine for the voices
we build and as a tool in the building process itself.  This chapter
gives a background on the philosophy of the system, its basic use, and
some lower level details on its internals that will make the
understanding of the whole synthesis task easier.</P
><P
>The Festival Speech Synthesis System was designed to target three
particular classes of speech synthesis user.
<P
></P
><OL
TYPE="1"
><LI
><P
>Speech synthesis researchers: where they may use Festival as a vehicle
for developmeent and testing of new research in synthesis technology.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Speech application developers: where synthesis is not the primary
interest, but Festival will be a substantial sub-component which may
require significant integration and hence the system must be open and
easily configurable.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>End user: where the system simple takes text and generates speech,
requiring no or very little configuration from the user.</P
></LI
></OL
></P
><P
>In the design of Festival it was important that all three classes of
user were served as there needs to be a clear route from research work
to practial usable systems as this not only encourages research to be
focussed but also, as has been shown by the large uptake of the
system, ensures there is a large user community interested in
seeing improvements to the system.</P
><P
>The Festival Speech Synthesis System was built based on the experience
of previous synthesis engines.  Design of a key architecture is
important as what may seem general to begin with can quickly become a
limiting factor, as new and more ambitious techniques are attempted
within it.  The basic architecture of Festival benefited mainly from
previous synthesis engines developed at Edinburgh University,
specifically Osprey [<SPAN
CLASS="CITATION"
>taylor91</SPAN
>].  ATR's CHATR
system, [<SPAN
CLASS="CITATION"
>black94</SPAN
>] was also a major influence on
Festival, CHATR's original core architecture was also developed by the
same authors as Festival.  In designing Festival, the intention was to
avoid the previous limitations in the utterance
representation and module specification, specifically in avoiding
constraints on the types of modules and dependencies between them.
However even with this intent, Festival went through a number of core
changes before it settled.</P
><P
>The Festival system consists of a set of C++ objects and core methods
suitable for doing synthesis tasks.  These objects include synthesis
specific objects like, waveforms, tracks and utterances as well as
more general objects like feature sets, n-grams, and decision trees.</P
><P
>In order to give parameters and specify flow of control Festival
offers a scripting language based on the Scheme programming language
[<SPAN
CLASS="CITATION"
>Scheme96</SPAN
>].  Having a scripting language is one of
the key factors that makes Festival a useful system.  Most of the
techniques in this book for building new voices within Festival can be
done without any changes to the core C++ objects.  This makes
development of new voices not only more accessible to a larger
population or users, as C++ knowledge nor a C++ compiler is necessary,
it also makes the distribution of voices built by these techniques
easy as users do not require any recompilation to use newly created
voices.</P
><P
>Scheme offers a very simple syntax but powerful language for
specifying parameters and simple functions.  Scheme was chosen as its
implementation is small and would not increase the size of the
Festival system unnecessarily.  Also, using an embedded Scheme
component does not increase the requirements for installation as would
the use of say Java, Perl or Python as the scripting language.  Scheme
frightens some people as Lisp based languages have an unfair
reputation for being slow.  Festival's use of Scheme is (in general)
limited to simple functions and very little time is spent in the
Scheme interpreter itself.  Automatic garbage collection also has a
reputation for slowing systems down.  In Festival, garbage collection
happens after each utterance is synthesized and again takes up only a
small amount of time but allows the programmer nor to have to worry
about explicitly freeing memory.</P
><P
>For the most part the third type of user, defined above, will never
need to change any part of the systems (though they usually find
something they want to change, like adding new entries to the
lexicon).  The second level of user typically does most of their
customizing in Scheme, though this is usually just modifying existing
pieces of Scheme in the way that people may add simple lines of Lisp
to their <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>.emacs</TT
> file.  It is primarily only the
synthesis research community that has to deal with the C++ end of the
system, though C/C++ interfaces to the systems as a library are also
provided (see <A
HREF="c3788.html"
>the Chapter called <I
>Festival Details</I
></A
> for more discussions
on APIs).</P
><P
>This chapter covers the basic use of the system and is followed by
more details of the internal structures, particularly the utterance
sturcture, accessing methods and modules.  These later sections are
probabaly more detail than one needs for building standard voices
described in the book, but the is information is necessary when more
ambituous voice building tasks are attempted.</P

examples are likely to work under any platform Festival supports.</P
><P
>The most simple way to use Festival to speak a file from
the command line, is by the command
<A

></A
><BLOCKQUOTE
CLASS="BLOCKQUOTE"
><P
CLASS="LITERALLAYOUT"
>festival&nbsp;--tts&nbsp;example.txt</P

This will speak the text in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>example.txt</TT
>
using the default voice.</P
><P
>Festival can also read text from <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>stdin</TT
> using
a command like
<A

></A
><BLOCKQUOTE
CLASS="BLOCKQUOTE"
><P
CLASS="LITERALLAYOUT"
>echo&nbsp;"Hello&nbsp;world"&nbsp;|&nbsp;festival&nbsp;--tts</P

></P
><P
>Festival actually offers two modes, a <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>text mode</I
>
and a <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>command mode</I
>.  In text mode everything
given to Festival is treated as text to be spoken.  In comamnd mode
everything is treated as Scheme commands and interpreted.</P
><P
>When festival is started with no arguments if goes into interactive
command mode.  There you may type Scheme command and have Festival
interpret them.  For example
<A

></A
><BLOCKQUOTE
CLASS="BLOCKQUOTE"
><P
CLASS="LITERALLAYOUT"
>$&nbsp;festival<br>
....<br>
festival&#62;</P

One simple command is <SAMP
CLASS="COMPUTEROUTPUT"
>SayText</SAMP
> takes
a single string argument and says its contents.
<A

You may select other voices for synthesis by calling the appropriate
function.  For example
<A

></A
><BLOCKQUOTE

CLASS="LITERALLAYOUT"

festival&#62;&nbsp;</P

>
Will use a female US English voice (if installed).</P
><P
>The command line interface offers comand line history though the up
and down arrows (ctrl-P and ctrl-N) and editing through standard
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>emacs</B
>-like commands.  Importantly the interface does
function and filename completion too, using the <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>TAB</B
>
key.</P
><P
>Any Scheme command may be typed at the command line for example
<A

>The <SAMP
CLASS="COMPUTEROUTPUT"
>SayText</SAMP
> is just a simple function
that takes the given string, constructs an utterance object from is,
synthesizes it and sends the resulting waveform to the audio device.
This isn't really suitable for synthesizing anythign but very short
utterances. The TTS process involves the more complex task of
splitting text streams into utterance synthesizing them and sendthem
to the audio device to they may play as the same time working on the
next utterance to that the audio output is continuous.  Festival does
this through the <SAMP
CLASS="COMPUTEROUTPUT"
>tts</SAMP
> function (which
is what is actually called when Festival is given the <SAMP
CLASS="COMPUTEROUTPUT"
>--tts</SAMP
> argument on the command line.  In Scheme the
<SAMP
CLASS="COMPUTEROUTPUT"
>tts</SAMP
> funciton takes two arguments, a
filename and a mode.  Modes are described in more detail in <A
HREF="x1361.html"
>the Section called <I
>TTS modes</I
> in the Chapter called <I
>Text analysis</I
></A
>, and can be used to allow special
processing of text, such as respecting markup or particular styles of
text like email etc.  In simple case the mode will be
<SAMP
CLASS="COMPUTEROUTPUT"
>nil</SAMP
> which denotes the basic raw
or fundamental mode.
