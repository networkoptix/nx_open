As touched on above the choice of an inventory of units can be viewed as 
a line from a small inventory phones, to diphones, triphones to 
arbitrary units. Though the direction you come from influences the 
selection of the units from the database. CHATR [<SPAN
CLASS="CITATION"
>campbell96</SPAN
>] lies 
firmly at the "arbitrary units" end of the spectrum. Although it can 
exclude bad units from its inventory it is very much <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>everything 
minus some</I
>"</SPAN
> view of the world. Microsoft's Whistler [<SPAN
CLASS="CITATION"
>huang97</SPAN
>] on 
the other hand, starts off with a general database base but selects 
typical units from it. Thus its inventory is substantially smaller than 
the full general database the units are extracted from. At the other 
end of the spectrum we have the fixed pre-specified inventory like 
diphone synthesis as has bee described in the previous chapter. </P
><P
>In this section we'll give some examples of moving along the line 
from the fixed pre-specified inventory to the words the more general 
inventories but these techniques still have a strong component 
of prespecification. </P
><P
>Firstly lets us assume you have a general database that is labeled with 
utterances as described above. We can extract a standard diphone 
database from this general database, however unless the database was 
specifically designed, a general database is unlikely to have diphone 
coverage. Even when phonetically rich databases are used such as Timit 
there is likely to be very few vowel-vowel diphones as they are 
comparatively rare. But as these diphone are rare we may be able to do 
with out them and hence it is at least an interesting exercise to 
extract an as complete as possible diphone index from a general 
database. </P
><P
>The simplest method is to linearly search for all phone-phone pairs in 
the phone set through all utterances simply taking the first example. 
Some same code is given in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>src/diphone/make_diphs_index.scm</TT
>. 
This basic idea is to load in all the utterances in a database, and 
index each segment by is phone name and succeeding phone name. Then 
various selection techniques can be use to select from the multiple 
candidates of each diphone (or you can split the indexing further). 
After selection a diphone index file can be saved. </P
><P
>The utterances to load are identified by a list of fileids. For 
example if the list of fileids (without parenthesis) is in 
the file <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>etc/fileids</TT
>, the following will builds a diphone 
index.

>Note that as this diphone index will contain a number of holes 
you will need to either augment it with <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"<I

>similar</I
>"</SPAN
> diphones 
or process your diphone selections through <CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>UniSyn_module_hooks</CODE
> 
as described in the previous chapter. </P
><P
>As you complicate the selection, and the number of diphones you used 
from the database you will need to complicate the names used to 
identify the diphones themselves. The convention of using underscores 
for syllable internal consonant clusters and dollars for syllable 
initial consonants can be followed, but you will need to go further if 
you wish to start introducing new feature such as phrase finality and 
stress. Eventually going to a generalized naming scheme (type and number) 
as used by the cluster selection technique described above, will prove 
worth while. Also using CART trees, through hand written and fully 
deterministic (one candidate at the leafs), will be a reasonable 
algorithm to select between hand stipulated alternatives with 
reasonable backoff strategies. </P
><P
>Another potential direction is to use the acoustic costs used in the 
clustering methods described in the previous section. These can be used 
to identify what the most typical unit in a cluster are (the mean 
distances from all other units are given in the leafs). Pruning these 
trees until the cluster only contain a single example should help to 
improve synthesis, in that variation in the feature in the "diphone" 
index will then be determined by the features specified in the cluster 
train algorithm. Of course though as you limit the number of distinct 
units types the more prosodic modification will be required by your 
signal processing algorithm, which requires that you have good pitch 
marks. </P
><P
>If you already have an existing database but don't wish to go to full 
unit selection, such techniques are probably quite feasible and worth 
further investigation. </P
