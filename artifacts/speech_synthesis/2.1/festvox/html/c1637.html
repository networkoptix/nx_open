>&#13;Prosodic phrasing in speech synthesis makes the whole speech more 
understandable. Due to the size of peoples lungs there is 
a finite length of time people can talk before they can take 
a breath, which defines an upper bound on prosodic phrases. However 
we rarely make our phrases this maximum length and use phrasing 
to mark groups within the speech. There is the apocryphal story 
of the speech synthesis example with an unnaturally long 
prosodic phrase played at a conference presentation. At the end 
of the phrase the audience all took a large in-take of breathe. </P
><P
>For the most case very simple prosodic phrasing is sufficient. 
A comparison of various prosodic phrasing techniques is 
discussed in [<SPAN
CLASS="CITATION"
>taylor98a</SPAN
>], though we will cover some 
of them here also. </P
><P
>For English (and most likely many other language too) simple rules based 
on punctuation is a very good predictor of prosodic phrase boundaries. 
It is rare that punctuation exists where there is no boundary, but there 
will be a substantial number of prosodic boundaries which are not 
explicitly marked with punctuation. Thus a prosodic phrasing algorithm 
solely based on punctuation will typically under predict but rarely make 
a false insertion. However depending on the actual application you wish 
to use the synthesizer for it may be the case that explicitly adding 
punctuation at desired phrase breaks is possible and a prediction system 
based solely on punctuation is adequate. </P
><P
>Festival basically supports two methods for predicting prosodic 
phrases, though any other method can easily be used. Note that these do 
not necessary entail pauses in the synthesized output. Pauses are 
further predicted from prosodic phrase information. </P
><P
>The first basic method is by CART tree. A test is made on each 
word to predict it is at the end of a prosodic phrase. The basic CART 
tree returns <CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>B</CODE
> or <CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>BB</CODE
> (though may return what you consider 
is appropriate form break labels as long as the rest of 
your models support it). The two levels identify different 
levels of break, <CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>BB</CODE
> being a used to denote a bigger 
break (and end of utterance). </P
><P
>&#13;The following tree is very simple and simply adds a break 
after the last word of a token that has following punctuation. 
Note the first condition is done by a lisp function as we wand to 
ensure that only the last word in a token gets the break. (Earlier 
erroneous versions of this would insert breaks after each word 
in <SPAN

This tree is defined <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>festival/lib/phrase.scm</TT
> in the standard 
distribution and is certainly a good first step in defining a phrasing 
model for a new language. </P
><P
>To make a better phrasing model requires more information. As the basic 
punctuation model underpredicts we need information that will find 
reasonable boundaries within strings of words. In English, boundaries 
are more likely between content words and function words, because most 
function words are before the words they related to, in Japanese 
function words are typically after their relate content words so breaks 
are more likely between function words and content words. If you have 
no data to train from, written rules, in a CART tree, can exploited this 
fact and give a phrasing model that is better than a punctuation only. 
Basically a rule could be if the current word is a content word and the 
next is a function word (or the reverse if that appropriate for a 
language) and we are more than 5 words from a punctuation symbol them 
predict a break. We maybe also want to insure that we are also at least 
five words from predicted break too. </P
><P
>Note the above basic rules aren't optimal but when you are building a 
new voice in a new language and have no data to train from you will get 
reasonably far with simple rules like that, such that phrasing 
prediction will be less of a problem than the other problems you will 
find in you voice. </P
><P
>&#13;

To implement such a scheme we need three basic functions: one to 
determine if the current word is a function of content word, one to 
determine number of words since previous punctuation (or start of 
utterance) and one to determine number of words to next punctuation (or 
end of utterance. The first of these functions is already provided for 
with a feature, through the feature function <CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>gpos</CODE
>. This uses 
the word list in the lisp variable <CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>guess_pos</CODE
> to determine the 
basic category of a word. Because in most languages the set of function 
words is very nearly a closed class they can usually be explicitly 
listed. The format of the <CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>guess_pos</CODE
> variable is a list of 
lists whose first element is the set name and the rest of the list if 
the words that are part of that set. Any word not a member of 
any of these sets is defined to be in the set <CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>content</CODE
>. For 
example the basic definition for this for English, 
given in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"

>A much better method for predicting phrase breaks is using a full 
statistical model trained from data. The problem is that you need a lot 
of data to train phrase break models. Elsewhere in this document we 
suggest the use of a timit style database or around 460 sentences, 
(around 14500 segments) for training models. However a database such as 
this as very few internal utterance phrase breaks. An almost perfect 
model word predict breaks at the end of each utterances and never 
internally. Even the f2b database from the Boston University Radio New 
Corpus [<SPAN
CLASS="CITATION"
>ostendorf95</SPAN
>] which does have a number of utterance internal 
breaks isn't really big enough. For English we used the MARSEC database 
[<SPAN
CLASS="CITATION"
>roach93</SPAN
>] which is much larger (around 37,000 words). Finding such 
a database for your language will not be easy and you may need to fall 
back on a purely hand written rule system. </P
><P
>&#13;Often syntax is suggested as a strong correlate of prosodic phrase. 
Although there is evidence that it influences prosodic phrasing, there 
are notable exceptions [<SPAN
CLASS="CITATION"
>bachenko90</SPAN
>]. Also considering how 
difficult it is to get a reliable parse tree it is probably not worth 
the effort, training a reliable parser is non-trivial, (though we 
provide a method for training stochastic context free grammars in the 
speech tools, see manual for details). Of course if your text to be 
synthesized is coming from a language system such as machine translation 
or language generation then a syntax tree may be readily available. In 
that case a simple rule mechanism taking into account syntactic phrasing 
may be useful </P
><P
>When only moderate amounts of data are available for training a simple 
CART tree may be able to tease out a reasonable model. See 
[<SPAN
CLASS="CITATION"
>hirschberg94</SPAN
>] for some discussion on this. Here is a short example 
of building a CART tree for phrase prediction. Let us assume you have a 
database of utterances as described previously. By convention we 
build models in directories under <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>festival/</TT

database directory. Thus let us create <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>festival/phrbrk</TT

><P
>&#13;First we need to list the features that are likely to be suitable 
predictors for phrase breaks. Add these to a file <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>phrbrk.feats</TT
>, 
what goes in here will depend on what you have, full part of speech 
helps a lot but you may not have that for your language. The

You will probably also want to set a <I

stop value is 50, which means there must be at least 50 examples 
in a group before it will consider looking for a question to 
split it. Unless you have a <I

too large and a value of 10 to 20 is probably more reasonable. </P
><P
>Other arguments to <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>wagon</TT

approach where all features are tested incrementally to find the best 
set of features which give the best tree can give better results than 
simply using all features. Though care should be taken with 
this as the generated tree becomes optimized from the given 
test set. Thus a further held our test set is required to 
properly test the accuracy of the result. In the stepwise case 
it is normal to split the train set again and call 
wagon as follows

The quality of all these three prosodic components is closely related 
such that if one is much better than there may not be
