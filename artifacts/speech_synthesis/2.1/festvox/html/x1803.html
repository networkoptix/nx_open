>&#13;Predicting where accents go (and their types) is only half of the 
problem. We also have build an F0 contour based on these. Note 
intonation is split between accent placement and F0 generation as it is 
obvious that accent position influences durations and an F0 contour 
cannot be generated without knowing the durations of the segments the 
contour is to be generated over. </P

regression/CART, and by Tilt. </P

The first is designed to be the most general and will always allow some 
form of F0 generation. This method allows target points to be 
programmatically created for each syllable in an utterance. The idea 
follows closely a generalization of the implementation of ToBI type 
accents in [<SPAN
CLASS="CITATION"
>anderson84</SPAN
>], where n-points are predicted for each 
accent. They (and others in intonation) appeal to the notion of 
baseline and place target F0 points above and below that line based on 
accent type, position in phrase. The baseline itself is often defined 
to decline over the phrase reflecting the general declination of F0 over 
type. </P
><P
>The simple idea behind this general method is that a Lisp function is 
called for each syllable in the utterance. That Lisp function returns a 
list of target F0 points that lie within that syllable. Thus the 
generality of this methods actual lies in the fact that it simply allows 
the user to program anything they want. For example our simple hat 
accent can be generated using this technique as follows. </P
><P
>This fixes the F0 range of the speaker so would need to 
be changed for different speakers.

It simply checks if the current syllable is accented and if so returns 
a list of position/target pairs. A value at the start of the 
syllable or 110Hz, a value at 140Hz at the mid-point of the syllable 
and a value of 100 at the end. </P
><P
>This general technique can be expanded with other rules as necessary. 
Festival includes an implementation of ToBI using exactly this 
technique, it is based on the rules described in [<SPAN
CLASS="CITATION"
>jilka96</SPAN
>] and in 
the file <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>festival/lib/tobi_f0.scm</TT

>F0 by linear regression</A
></H2
><P
>&#13;This technique was developed specifically to avoid the difficult 
decisions of exactly what parameters with what value should be used in 
rules like those of [<SPAN
CLASS="CITATION"
>anderson84</SPAN
>]. The first implementation of this 
work is presented [<SPAN
CLASS="CITATION"
>black96</SPAN
>]. The idea is to find the appropriate F0 
target value for each syllable based on available features by training 
from data. A set of features are collected for each syllable and a 
linear regression model is used to model three points on each syllable. 
The technique produces reasonable synthesis and requires less analysis 
of the intonation models that would be required to write a rule system 
using the general F0 target method described in the previous section. </P
><P
>However to be fair, this technique is also much simpler and there are 
are obviously a number of intonational phenomena which this cannot 
capture (e.g. multiple accents on syllables and it will never really 
capture accent placement with respect to the vowel). The previous 
technique allows specification of structure but without explicit 
training from data (though doesn't exclude that) while this technique 
imposes almost no structure but depends solely on data. The Tilt 
modeling discussed in the following section tries to balance these two 
extremes. </P
><P
>The advantage of the linear regression method is very little 
knowledge about the intonation the language under study needs to be 
known. Of course if there is knowledge and theories it is usually 
better to follow them (or at least find the features which influence 
the F0 in that language). Extracting features for F0 modeling 
is similar to extracting features for the other models. This 
time we want the means F0 at the start middle and end of 
each utterance. The Festival features <CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>syl_startpitch</CODE
>, 
<CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>syl_midpitch</CODE
> and <CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>syl_endpitch</CODE
> proved this. Note 
that <CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>syl_midpitch</CODE
> returns the pitch at the mid of the 
vowel in the syllable rather than the middle of the syllable. </P
><P
>For a linear regression model all features <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>must</I
> be continuous. 
Thus features which are categorical that influence F0 need to be 
converted. The standard technique for this is to introduce new features, 
one for each possible value in the class and output values of 0 or 1 
for these modified features depending on the value of the base features. 
For example in a ToBI environment the output of the feature 
<CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>tobi_accent</CODE
> will include <CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>H*</CODE
>, <CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>L*</CODE
>, <CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>L+H*</CODE
> etc. 
In the modified form you would have features of the form 
<CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>tobi_accent_H*</CODE
>, <CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>tobi_accent_L*</CODE
>, <CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>tobi_accent_L_H*</CODE
>, 
etc. </P
><P
>&#13;

The program <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>ols</TT
> in the speech tools takes feature files and 
description files in exactly the same format as <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>wagon</TT
>, except 
that all feature must be declared as type <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>float</TT
>. The standard 
ordinary least squares algorithm used to find the coefficients 
cannot, in general, deal with features that are directly correlated 
with others as this causes a singularity when inverting the 
matrix. The solution to this is to exclude such features. The 
option <CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>-robust</CODE
> enables that though at the expense of a longer 
compute time. Again like <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>file</TT
> a stepwise option is included 
so that the best subset of features may be found. </P
><P
>The resulting models may be used by the <CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>Int_Targets_LR</CODE
> module 
which takes its LR models from the variables <CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>f0_lr_start</CODE
>, 
<CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>f0_lr_mid</CODE
> and <CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>f0_lr_end</CODE
>. The output of <CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>ols</CODE
> is a 
list of coefficients (with the Intercept first). These need to be 
converted to the appropriate bracket form including their feature names. 
An example of which is in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>festival/lib/f2bf0lr.scm</TT
>. </P
><P
>&#13;If the conversion of categoricals to floats seems to much work 
or would prohibitively increase the number of features you 
could use <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>wagon</TT
> to generate trees to predict F0 values. 
The advantage is that of a decision tree over the LR model is that 
it can deal with data in a non-linear fashion, But this is 
also the disadvantage. Also the decision tree technique may 
split the data sub-optimally. The LR model is probably more 
theoretically appropriate but ultimately the results depend on 
how goods the models sound. </P
><P
>Dump features as with the LR models, but this time there is 
no need convert categorical features to floats. A potential 
set of features to do this from (substitute <CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>syl_midpitch</CODE
> 
and <CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>syl_endpitch</CODE

></H2
><P
>&#13;Tilt modeling is still under development and not as mature as the other 
methods as described above, but it potentially offers a more consistent 
solution to the problem. A tilt parameterization of a natural F0 
contour can be automatically derived from a waveform and a labeling of 
accent placements (a simple <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>a</I
>"</SPAN
> for accents and <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"<I

boundaries) [<SPAN

automatically find the accents placements too. </P
><P
>For each <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>a</I
>"</SPAN
> in an labeling four continuous parameters are found: 
height, duration, peak position with respect to vowel start, and tilt. 
Prediction models may then be generate to predict these parameters which 
we feel better capture the dimensions of F0 contour itself. We have had 
success in building models for these parameters, [<SPAN
CLASS="CITATION"
>dusterhoff97a</SPAN
>], 
with better results than the linear regression model on comparable data. 
However so far we have not done any tests with Tilt on languages other 
than English. </P
