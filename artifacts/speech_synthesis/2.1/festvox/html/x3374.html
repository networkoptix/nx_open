>&#13;It is very easy to build a voice and get it to say a few phrases and
think that the job is done. As you build the voice it is worth testing
each part as you built it to ensure it basically performs as expected.
But once its all together more general tests are needed.  Before you
submit it to any formal tests that you will use for benchmarking and
grading progrees in the voice, more basic tests should
be carried out.&#13;</P
><P
>&#13;In fact it is stating such initial tests more concretely. <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Every</I
> we have ever built has always had a number mistakes
in it that can be trivially fixed.  Such as the mfccs were not
generated after fixing the pitchmarks.  Therefore you syould go
through each stage of the build procedure and ensure it really did do
what you though it should do, especially if you are totally convinced
that section worked perfectly.&#13;</P
><P
>&#13;Try to find around 100-500 sentences to play through it. It is amazing
home many general problems are thrown up when you extend your test
set.  The next stage is to play so <I

text. That may be news text from the web, output from your speech
translation system, or some email.  Initially it is worth just
synthesizing the whole set without even listening to it. Problems in
analysis and missing diphones etc may be shown up just in the
processing of the text. Then you want to listen to the output and
identify problems. This make take some amount of investigation. What
you want to do is identify <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>where</I
> the problem is,
is it bad tex analysis, bad lexical entry, a prosody problem, or a
waveform synthesis problem. You may need to synthesizes parts of the
text in isolation (e.g. using the Festival function
<CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>SayText</CODE
> and look at the structure of the utterance
generated, e.g. using the function
<CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>utt.features</CODE
>. For example to see what words have
been identified from the text analysis

<A
NAME="AEN3384"
></A
><BLOCKQUOTE
CLASS="BLOCKQUOTE"
><P
CLASS="LITERALLAYOUT"
>(utt.features&nbsp;utt1&nbsp;'Word&nbsp;'(name))</P
></BLOCKQUOTE
>
Or to see the phones generated 
<A
NAME="AEN3386"
></A
><BLOCKQUOTE
CLASS="BLOCKQUOTE"
><P
CLASS="LITERALLAYOUT"
>(utt.features&nbsp;utt1&nbsp;'Segment&nbsp;'(name))</P
></BLOCKQUOTE
>
Thus you can view selected parts of an utterance and find out 
if it is being created as you intended. For some things 
a graphical display of the utterance may help.&#13;</P
><P
>&#13;Once you identify <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>where</I
> the problem is you need
to decide how to fix it (or if it is worth fixing).  The problem may
be a number of different places:&#13;</P

>&#13;Before rushing out and getting one hundred people to listen to your
new synthetic voice, it is worth doing significant internal testing
and evaluation, informally to find errors and test them.  Remember the
purpose of evaluation in this case is to find errors and fix them.  We
are not, at least not at this stage, evaluating the voices on an
abstract scale, where unseen test data, and blind testing is
important.&#13;</P
