a word. This is either by a lexicon (a large list of words 
and their pronunciations) or by some method of letter to 
sound rules. </P

>A pronunciation in Festival requires not just a list of 
phones but also a syllabic structure. In some languages the 
syllabic structure is very simple and well defined and 
can be unambiguously derived from a phone string. In English 
however this may not always be the case (compound nouns 
being the difficult case). </P
><P
>The lexicon structure that is basically available in Festival takes both 
a word and a part of speech (and arbitrary token) to find the given 
pronunciation. For English this is probably the optimal form, although 
there exist homographs in the language, the word itself and a fairly 
broad part of speech tag will mostly identify the proper pronunciation. </P

Not that in addition to explicit marking of syllables a stress 
value is also given (0 or 1). In some languages lexical is 
fully predictable, in others highly irregular. In some this 
field may be more appropriately used for an other purpose, 
e.g. tone type in Chinese. </P

>There may be other languages which require a more complex (less 
complex) format and the decision to use some other format rather 
than this one is up to you. </P

>&#13;Currently there is only residual support for morphological analysis in 
Festival. A finite state transducer based analyzer for English based on 
the work in [<SPAN
CLASS="CITATION"
>ritchie92</SPAN
>] is included in 
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>festival/lib/engmorph.scm</TT
> and 
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>festival/lib/engmorphsyn.scm</TT
>. But this should be considered 
experimental at best. Give the lack of such an analyzer our lexicons 
need to list not only based forms of words but also all their 
morphological variants. This is (more or less) acceptable in languages 
such as English or French but which languages with richer morphology 
such as German it may seem an unnecessary requirement. Agglutenative 
languages such as Finnish and Turkish this appears to be even more a 
restriction. This is probably true but this current restriction 
not necessary hopeless. We have successfully build very good 
letter-to-sound rules for German, a language with a rich morphology 
which allows the system to properly predict pronunciations of 
morphological variants of root words it has not seen before. 
We have not yet done any experiments with Finnish or Turkish 
but see this technique would work, (though of course developing 
a properly morphological analyzer would be better). </P
