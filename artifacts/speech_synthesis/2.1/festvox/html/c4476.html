You will likely need to reference these manuals often. </P

>It will also be useful to have access to other voices development 
in Festival as seeing how others solve problems may make 
things clearer. </P

>In addition to Festival itself a number of other projects throughout 
the world use Festival and have also released resources. The 
<SPAN

It is worth mentioning Oregon Graduate Institute here who have done a 
lot of work with the system and release other voices for it (US English 
and Mexican Spanish). See <A
HREF="http://cslu.cse.ogi.edu/tts/"
TARGET="_top"
>http://cslu.cse.ogi.edu/tts/</A
> for more 
details. </P
><P
>&#13;A second project worth mention, is the MBROLA project [<SPAN
CLASS="CITATION"
>dutoit96</SPAN
>] 
<A
HREF="http://tcts.fpms.ac.be/synthesis/mbrola.html"
TARGET="_top"
>http://tcts.fpms.ac.be/synthesis/mbrola.html</A
>, they offer a 
waveform synthesis technique [<SPAN
CLASS="CITATION"
>dutoit93</SPAN
>] and a number of diphone 
database for lots of different languages. MBROLA itself doesn't offer a 
front end, just phone, duration and F0 target to waveform synthesis. 
(However the do offer a full French TTS system too.) Their diphone 
databases complement Festival well and a number of projects use MBROLA 
databases for their waveform synthesis and Festival as the front end. 
If you lack resources to record and build diphone databases this is a 
good place to check for existing diphone databases for languages. Most 
of their databases have some use/distribution restrictions but they 
usually allow any non-commercial use. </P
