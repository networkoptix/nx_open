in a new language, and adding a new voice in a language already 
supported by Festival. </P

Because we are most familiar with a Unix environment the scripts, tools 
etc. assume such a basic environment. This is not to say you couldn't 
run these scripts on other platforms as many of these tools are 
supported on platforms like WIN32, its just that in our normal work 
environment, Unix is ubiquitous and we like working in it. Festival 
also runs on Win32 platforms. </P
><P
>Much of the testing was done under Linux; wherever possible, 
we are using freely available tools. We are happy to say that 
no non-free tools are required to build voices, and we have 
included citations and/or links to everything needed in this 
document. </P
><P
>We assume Festival 1.4.3 and the Edinburgh Speech Tools 1.2.3.</P
><P
>Note that we make an extensive use of the Speech Tools programs, and you 
will need the full distribution of them as well as Festival, rather than 
the run-time (binary) only versions which are available for some Linux 
platforms. If you find the task of compiling Festival and the speech 
tools daunting, you will probably find the rest of the tasks specified 
in this document more so. However, it is not necessary for you to have 
any knowledge of C++ to make voices, though familiarity with text 
processing techniques (e.g. awk, sed, perl) will make understanding the 
examples given much easier. </P
><P
>We also assume a basic knowledge of Festival, and of speech processing 
in general. We expect the reader to be familiar with basic terms such as 
<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>F0</I
>, <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>phoneme</I
>, and <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>cepstrum</I
>, but not in any real 
detail. References to general texts are given (when we know them to 
exist). A basic knowledge of programming in Scheme (and/or Lisp) will 
also make things easier. A basic capability in programming in general 
will make defining rules, etc., much easier. </P
><P
>&#13;If you are going to record your own database, you will need recording 
equipment: the higher quality, the better. A proper recording studio is 
ideal, though may not be available for everyone. A cheap microphone 
stuck on the back of standard PC is not ideal, though we know most of 
you will end up doing that. A high quality sound board, close-talking, 
high quality microphone and a nearly soundproof recording environment 
will often be the compromise between these two extremes. </P
><P
>&#13;Many of the techniques described in here require a fair amount of 
processing time to achieve, though machines are indeed getting faster 
and this is becoming less of an issue. If you use the provided aligner 
for labeling diphones you will need a processor of reasonable speed, 
likewise for the various training techniques for intonation, duration 
modeling and letter-to-sound rules. Nothing presented here takes weeks 
though a number of processes may be over-night jobs, depending on the 
speed of your machine, and size of your database. </P
><P
>Also we think that you will need a little patience. The process of 
building a voice is not necessarily going to work first time. It may 
even fail completely, so if you don't expect anything special, you wont 
be disappointed. </P
