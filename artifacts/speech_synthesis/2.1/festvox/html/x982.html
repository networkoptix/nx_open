>The basic cluster unit selection code available in festival uses 
segments as the size of unit. However the acoustic distance measure 
used in cluster uses significant portions of the previous segment. Thus 
the cluster unit selection effectively selects diphones from the 
database. </P
><P
>The type of units the cluster selection code uses is based on the 
segment name, by default. In the case of limited domain synthesis we 
have found that constraining this further gives both better, and faster 
synthesis. Thus we allow for the unit type to be defined by an 
arbitrary feature. In the default limited domain set up 
we use 
<A
NAME="AEN986"

That is, the segment plus the word the segment comes from. Note 
this doesn't mean we are doing <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>word</I
> concatenation in our 
synthesizer. We are still selecting phone units but that the 
these phone are differentiated depending on the word they come from 
thus a /t/ from the word "unit" cannot be used to synthesis a /t/ in 
"table". The primary reason for us doing this was to cut down 
the search, though it notable improves synthesis quality to. As we 
have constructed the database to have good coverage this is a practical 
thing to do. </P
><P
>The feature function <CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>clunit_name</CODE
> constructs the unit type for a 
particular segment item. We have provided the above default (segment 
name plus (downcased) word name), but it is easy to extend this. </P
><P
>In one domain we have worked in we wish to differentiate between words 
in different prosody contexts. Particularly we wished to mark words us 
"questionable" so we can ask users for confirmation. To do this we 
marked the "questionable" words in the prompts with a question mark 
prefix. We then recorded them with appropriate intonation and then 
defined our <CODE
CLASS="VARNAME"
>clunit_name</CODE
> function in include "C_" is the word was 
prefixed by a question mark. For example the following two prompts 
will be read in a different manner 
<A
NAME="AEN993"
></A

></BLOCKQUOTE

Likewise in unit selection the units in the word "Squirrel" will not be 
used to synthesize the word "?Squirrel" and vice versa. Although crude, 
this does give simple control over prosody variation though this technique 
can require the vocabulary of the units to increase to where this 
technique ceases to be practical. </P
><P
>It would be good if this technique had a back-off strategy where if no 
unit can be found for a particular word it would allow other words to 
contribute candidates. This is ultimately what general unit selection 
is. We do consider this our goal in unit type but in the interest of 
building quick and reliable limited domain synthesizers we do not yet do 
this but consider it an area we will experiment with. One specific area 
that only partially cross this line is in the synthesis of numbers. It 
seem very reasonable to allow selection of units from simple numbers 
(e.g. "seven" and "seventy") but we have not experimented on that yet. </P
><P
>One further important point should be highlights about this method 
for defining unit types. Although including the word name in the unit 
name does greatly encourage whole words to be selected it does not 
mean that joins in the synthesize utterances only occur at word 
boundaries. It is common that contiguous units are selection from 
different occurrences of the same word. Mid-word (e.g. within 
vowels, or at stops) joins at stable places are common. The optimal 
coupling technique selects the best place within a word for the cross 
over between two different parts of the database. </P
