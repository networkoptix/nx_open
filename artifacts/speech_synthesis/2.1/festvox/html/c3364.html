>Now that you have built your voice, how can you tell if it works, and 
how can you find out what you need to make it better. This chapter 
deals with some issues of evaluating a voice in Festival. Some 
of the points here also apply to testing and improving existing voices 
too. </P
><P
>The evaluation of speech synthesis is notoriously hard. Evaluation in
speech recognition was the major factor in making general speech
recognition work. Rigourous tests on well defined data made the
evaluation of different techniques possible. Though in spite of its
success the strict evaluation criteria as used in speech recognition
can cloud the ultimate goal. It is important always to remember that
tests are there to evaluate a systems performance rather than become
the task itself. Just as techniques can overtrain on data it is
possible to over train on the test data and/or methodology too thus
loosing the generality and purpose of the evaluation.</P
><P
>In speech recognition a simple (though naive) measure of phones or words 
correct gives a reasonable indicator of how well a speech recognition 
system works. In synthesis this a lot harder. A word can have multiple 
pronunciations, so it is much harder to automatically test if a 
synthesizer's phoneme accuracy, besides much of the quality is not just 
in if it is correct but if it "sounds good".  This is effectly the crux
of the matter. The only real synthesis evaluation technique is having 
a human listen to the result. Humans individually are not very reliably 
testers of systems, but humans in general are. However it is usually 
not feasible to have testers listen to large amounts of synthetic speech 
and return a general goodness score. More specific tests are required. </P
><P
>Although listening tests are the ultimate, because they are expensive in 
resources (undergraduates are not willing to listing to bad synthesis 
all day for free), and the design of listening tests is a non-trivial 
task, there are a number of more general tests which can be run at less 
expenses and can help greatly. </P
><P
>It is common that a new voice in Festival (or any other speech synthesis 
systems), has limitations and it is wise to test what the limitations 
are and decide if such limitations are acceptable or not. This depends 
a lot on what you wish to use your voice for. For example if the voice 
a Scottish English voice to be primarily used as the output of a Chinese 
speech tranlation system, the vocabulary is constained by the 
translation system itself so a large lexicon is probabaly not much of an 
issue, but the vocabulary will include many anglosized (calenodianized 
?) versions of Chinese names, which are not common in standard English 
so letter-to-sound rules should be made more sensitive for that input. 
If the system is to be used to read address lists, it should be able to 
tokenize names and address appropriately, and if it is to be used in a 
dialogue system the intonation model should be able to deal with 
questions and continuations properly. Optimizing your voices for the 
most common task, and minimizing the errors is what evaluation is for. </P
