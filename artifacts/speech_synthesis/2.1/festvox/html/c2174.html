To make life easier in designing prompt list we have included scripts
which go some way to aid the process.  The general idea is to take a
very large amount of text and automatically find "nice" utterances
that match these criteria.</P
><P
>The CMU ARCTIC Database prompt list [<SPAN
CLASS="CITATION"
>kominek 2003</SPAN
>]
was created very much in this way, though with an earlier version of
the scripts.</P
><P
>&#13;As with most of our work there is a single script, that does a number
of basic stages.  The default is reasonable in many cases, but with
prompt selection it is always worth hand checking and potentially
modifying and refining the process.&#13;</P
><P
>&#13;The basic idea is to limit the chosen utterances to those of a
reasonable length (5-15 words), only choose sentences with high
frequency words (which should be easier to say and less ambiguous in
pronunciation, also restrict to words that are in the lexicon
(avoiding letter to sound issues).&#13;</P
><P
>&#13;The script <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>make_nice_prompts</TT
> is set up for two
classes of language, Latin script languages and non-Latin script
languages.  Though as the non-Latin case is much more varied you may
need to modify things.  We have successfully used it for UTF-8 encoded
Hindi.&#13;</P
><P
>&#13;For the Latin-script languages (as opposed "asis" cases) we downcase
the text when looking for variation.  Although some Latin based
language make a significant case distinction, e.g. German, this is a
reasonable route to avoid sentences with too many repeated words in
them.&#13;</P
><P
>&#13;First gather lots of text data.  When we say lots we mean at least
millions of words, or even 10s on millions of words.  This basic
selection process is aimed at getting sentences for general voices and
hence as large amount of starting data as possible is important.&#13;</P
><P
>&#13;Please also note the copyright of the data you are selecting from.  In
CMU ARCTIC we used out-of-copyright texts from the Gutenberg project,
so there would be no issue in distributing the data.  Copyright law in
many countries allows for small subsets for copyright data, but this
fair use is often argued by some.  There may note actually be a good
solution to this, News stories, are typically copyright but the press
agency releasing them.  Licenses on LDC data are often sufficient for
using such texts to build prompts and then having no restriction on
the voices generated, but the database itself may be under question.
If you care about distribution (free or selling) you will need to
address these issues.&#13;</P
><P
>&#13;The first stage once you have collected you data is check its
encoding.  Make sure its all the same encoding.  Also check its
reasonable.  For example the Europal data is nice and clean (as
conditioned for Machine Translation models) but the punctuation has
been separated from the words.  You may want to to de-htmlify your
data before passing it to the selection routines.&#13;</P
><P
>&#13;Once you have a set of nice relatively clean data, you use the first
stage of the script.  This finds the word frequencies of all the
tokens in the text data.

Give all the text files as arguments to this script.  The working
files will be created in the current directory, but the text file
arguments may be pathnames.&#13;</P
><P
>&#13;The next stage is to build a Festival lexicon for the most frequent
words.  By default we select the top 5000 words, which has proven a
reasonable choice.  You can optionally override the 5000 with an
argument.

><P
>&#13;The next stage processes each sentence in the large text database to
find those utterances that are "nice".  That of reasonable length, has
only words in the frequency lexicon, no strange punctuation, capitals
at the beginning, and punctuation at the end, and a few other
heuristic rule conditions.  These seem to work well for the
Latin-script languages (though it is possible the conditions are
overly strict for some languages).  &#13;</P
><P
>&#13;Although Festival's text front end is used for processing the text,
you do not need to build any language specific text front end (at
least not normally).  Finding nice prompts is considered one of the
very first parts of buildings support for a new language, so we are
aware that there will be almost no resources available for the target
language yet.&#13;</P
><P
>&#13;Because this process is using Festival's front end, it is not fast, as
it needs to process the whole text database.  It is not unusual for
this to take a number of hours to process.  While processing "nice"
utterances are written to <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>data_nice.data</TT
>.  You
should check this regularly in case there is some inappropriate
condition in the rules and you are getting the wrong type of data.

Note this will only search for the first 100,000 nice utterances, from
the data set, you can change the number in the script if you want more
(or less).  &#13;</P
><P
>&#13;Once the "nice" utterances are found you can now find those nice
utterances that have the best phonetic coverage.  There are two
mechanism available here.  Because this is often the very first stage
in building support for a new language, no lexicon and phonetics are
available, thus selecting based on phonetic is not an option.
Therefore we provide a simpler technique that selections based on
letter coverage (in fact di-letter coverage).  This is often a
reasonable solution, but it will depend on the language whether this
is reasonable solution or not.  Note that for English, in spite of its
somewhat poor relationship between orthography and pronunciation, this
is reasonable, so don't exclude this as a possibility without trying
it.&#13;</P
><P
>&#13;Letter selection will find the subset of the nice utterances that has
the best letter coverage.  It is a greedy algorithm, but this is
usually sufficient.  This process also takes a number to define the
number of utterances it is looking for.  The process will be applied
multiple times to the remaining data until that number is reached.  If
there isn't enough data to select from it might loop for ever.  By
default it looks for 1000 utterance, which is not unreasonable for a
unit selection voices, 500 is probably sufficient for a CLUSTERGEN
voice.  But, as they say, your mileage may vary.

>&#13;If you do have a pronunciation lexicon for you language, you can also do
select based on segments rather than letters.  We have not done
exhaustive comparisons of how valuable segment selection is over
letter selection.  It is clear that although probably important, it is
probably less important that selecting a good voice talent, or
recording the prompts in a high quality manner.  Two stages are
required for segment selection.  The first stage is to render the nice
prompts from words to segments

<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>data.done.data</TT

be perfect.  I have never done this for a new language, without having
to do it multiple times until I get something reasonable.  Even once
you have the result, it is worth while checking each utterance and
correcting and/or rejecting it for other reasons, such as
ungrammatical, hard to read, ambiguous words etc.  Be bold and get rid
of weird sentences, it will save you trouble later.  The selection
process is deliberately designed to have redundancy as speech is a
variable medium and we can never be sure what exact the voice talent
will say, or how the unit selection process will select the units from
the database.&#13;</P
><P
>&#13;It is wise to first go through every sentence and attempt to record it
and at that time decide if the sentence is actually a reasonable
utterance to include in the prompt set for that language.&#13;</P
><P
>&#13;The final stage extracts the vocabulary of the selected prompt set.
You can use this vocab list to start building your pronunciation
lexicon as you will need that to build your speech databases (unless
you are using an orthography based selection technique).
