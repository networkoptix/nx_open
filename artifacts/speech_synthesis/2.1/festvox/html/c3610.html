When building a new diphone based voice for a supported language, such 
as English, the upper parts of the systems can mostly be taken from 
existing voices, thus making the building task simpler. Of course, 
things can still go wrong, and its worth checking everything at each 
stage. This section gives the basic walkthrough for building a new US 
English voice. Support for building UK (southern, RP dialect) is also 
provided this way. For building non-US/UK synthesizers see 
<A
HREF="c3447.html"
>the Chapter called <I
>A Japanese Diphone Voice</I
></A
>
for a similar walkthrough but also covering the full text, lexicona
nd prosody issues which we can subsume in this example. </P
><P
>Recording a whole diphone set usually takes a number of hours, <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>if</I
> 
everything goes to plan. Construction of the voice after recording may 
take another couple of hours, though much of this is CPU bound. Then 
hand-correction may take at least another few hours (depending on the 
quality). Thus if all goes well it is possible to construct a new voice 
in a day's work though usually something goes wrong and it takes longer. 
The more time you spend making sure the data is correctly aligned and 
labeled, the better the results will be. While something can be made 
quickly, it can take much longer to do it very well. </P
><P
>For those of you who have ignored the rest of this document and are just 
hoping to get by by reading this, good luck. It may be possible to do 
that, but considering the time you'll need to invest to build a voice, 
being familar with the comments, at least in the rest of this chapter, 
may be well worth the time invested. </P

The next stage is to select a directory to build the voice. You will 
need in the order of 500M of diskspace to do this, it could 
be done in less, but its better to have enough to start with. Make a 
new directory and cd into it 
<A

CLASS="LITERALLAYOUT"
>mkdir&nbsp;~/data/cmu_us_awb_diphone<br>
cd&nbsp;~/data/cmu_us_awb_diphone</P
></BLOCKQUOTE
>
By convention, the directory is named for the institution, the language 
(here, <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>us</TT
> English) and the speaker 
(<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>awb</TT
>, who actually 
speaks with a Scottish accent). Although it can be fixed later, the 
directory name is used when festival searches for available voices, so 
it is good to follow this convention. </P

the arguments to <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>setup_diphone</TT
> are, the institution building the 
voice, the language, and the name of the speaker. If you don't have a 
institution we recommend you use <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>net</TT
>. There is an ISO standard 
for language names, though unfortunately it doesn't allow distinction 
between US and UK English, so in general we recommend you use the two 
letter form, though for US English use <TT

<TT

environment so it is best. Note all power levels so that if more than 
one session is required you can continue and still get the same 
recording quality. Given the length of the US English list, its 
unlikely a person can say allow of these in one sitting without taking 
breaks at least, so ensuring the environment can be duplicated is 
important, even if it's only after a good stretch and a drink of water.

When there has been no hand correction of the labels this stage may fail 
with diphones not having proper start, mid and end values. This happens 
when the automatic labeled has position two labels at the same point. 
For each diphone that has a problem find out which file it comes from 
(grep for it in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>dic/awbdiph.est</TT
> and use <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>emulabel</TT
> to change 
the labeling to as its correct. For example suppose "ah-m" is wrong 
you'll find is comes from <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>us_0314</TT

After correcting labels you must re-run the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>make_diph_index</TT
> 
command. You should also re-run the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>find_powerfacts</TT
> stage 
and <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>make_lpc</TT
> stages as these too depend on the labels, but 
this takes longer to run and perhaps that need only be done when 
you've corrected many labels. </P

As the autolabeling is unlikely to work completely you should 
listen to a number of examples to find out what diphones have 
gone wrong. </P

Finally, once you have corrected the errors (did we mention you need to 
check and correct the errors?), you can build a final voice suitable for 
distribution. First you need to create a group file which contains only 
the subparts of spoken words which contain the diphones.

The next stage is to integrate this new voice so that festival can find 
it automatically. To do this, you should add a symbolic link from the 
voice directory of Festival's English voices to the directory containing 
the new voice. First cd to festival's voice directory (this will vary 
depending on where you installed festival)

The final stage is to generate a distribution file so the voice may 
be installed on other's festival installations. Before you do 
this you must add a file <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>COPYING</TT

built the diphone database in. This should state the terms and conditions 
in which people may use, distribute and modify the voice. </P
