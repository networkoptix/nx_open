Program for Constructing Parameter File for GMM Mapping
* FOR LITTLE ENDIAN

usage: gmm_para [options...] [weightfile] [meanfile] [covfile] [outfile]
options:
        -dim dim[40]                    : dimension of joint vector
        -ydim ydim[20]                  : dimension of vector Y
        -dia                            : use diagonal covariance matrix
        -yx                             : parameter for inverse conversion, Y-to-X
        -inv                            : output weight, mean and cov files from param file
        -nmsg                           : no message
        -help                           : display this message

Three input files are binary files of weights, mean vectors and
covariance matrices. The output file is a binary parameter file for
the GMM mapping. If -inv is used, three binary files of weights, mean
vectors and covariance matrices are inversely generated from the input
GMM parameter file.

The number of dimensions of a joint feature vector is changed by
-dim, and the number of dimensions of vector Y is changed by -ydim,
i.e., the number of dimensions of vector X is [dim]-[ydim].

If -dia is used, the GMM parameter file has diagonal covariance
matrices. In this case, the number of dimensions of vector X should
be equal to that of vector Y.

If -yx is used, the output is the GMM parameter file for the inverse
mapping, i.e., a mapping from Y to X.

Binary data has double-type format.

Some messages are printed while executing this program. If you
don't need those messages, use -nmsg.


<EXAMPLE>
% gmm_para \
	-dim 48 \
	-ydim 24 \
	-dia \
	-nmsg \
	input.wghts \
	input.means \
	input.covs \
	output.param
