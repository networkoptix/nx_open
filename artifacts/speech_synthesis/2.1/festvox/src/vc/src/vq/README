Program for VQ with LBG Algorithm
* FOR LITTLE ENDIAN

usage: lbg [options...] [infile] [outlabel]
options:
        -dim dim[25]                    : dimension of vector
        -sd sd[0]                       : start dim
        -cls cls[1]                     : codebook size
        -float                          : float format
        -nmsg                           : no message
        -help                           : display this message

The input file is a binary file of feature vectors. Output files
whose names are "[outlabel]#.mat" are generated.

The number of dimensions of feature vectors is changed by -dim. A
distance between feature vectors for performing VQ is calculated with
the [sd]-th through ([dim]-1)-th coefficients, where [sd] is changed
by -sd.

The codebook size is changed by -cls. This size is based on
2^N, i.e., 1, 2, 4, ... If -cls is se to to 8, four codebooks
are generated, i.e.,
[outlabel]1.mat for 1 class,
[outlabel]2.mat for 2 classes,
[outlabel]4.mat for 4 classes, and
[outlabel]8.mat for 8 classes.

Binary data has double-type format. If -float is used, data has
float-type format.

Some messages are printed while executing this program. If you
don't need those messages, use -nmsg.


<EXAMPLE>
% lbg \
	-dim 48 \
	-cls 128 \
	input.vecs \
	output.cls \
	> log.txt
