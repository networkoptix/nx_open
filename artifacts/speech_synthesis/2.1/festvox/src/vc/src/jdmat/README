Program for Creating Joint Feature Vectors
* FOR LITTLE ENDIAN

usage: jdmat [options...] [mat1file] [mat2file] [outfile]
options:
        -dim1 dim1[1]                   : dimension of vector (mat1file)
        -dim2 dim2[24]                  : dimension of vector (mat2file)
        -nmsg                           : no message
        -help                           : display this message

Two input files and the output file are binary files of feature
vectors.

Output joint feature vectors are constructed by concatenating two
input feature vectors. The number of dimensions of the first input
vectors is changed by -dim1, and that of the second input vectors is
changed by -dim2.

Binary data has double-type format.

Some messages are printed while executing this program. If you
don't need those messages, use -nmsg.


<EXAMPLE>
% jdmat \
	-dim1 24 \
	-dim2 24 \
	-nmsg \
	input1.vecs \
	input2.vecs \
	output.jvecs
