How to Build a Voice Transformation model from one voice
to another.

If you want to build a FestVox voice with a transformation filter
see below.

TRAINING

For example suppose you wanted to convert some a database of waveform
files to a new voice.  Let's call the databases awb, and the target
speaker bdl.

First select 30-40 sentences from the awb database, and have
speaker bdl record these, so you have the same recordings of teh
30-40 senetcnes for both the original (awb) and target (bdl) speakers

Set up the following directory structure

    mkdir vc
    cd vc
    mkdir list
    mkdir wav

Put your waveforms in wav/ with each voice in different sub-directories, e.g.

    wav/awb/arctic_a0001.wav
    wav/awb/arctic_a0002.wav
    wav/awb/arctic_a0003.wav
    wav/awb/... etc

    wav/bdl/arctic_a0001.wav
    wav/bdl/arctic_a0002.wav
    wav/bdl/arctic_a0003.wav
    wav/bdl/... etc

Create two list files in the list/ directory identifying the files
for each speakers e.g. in list/awb_tr.list 
    awb/arctic_a0001
    awb/arctic_a0002
    awb/arctic_a0003
    ...
and in list/bdl_tr.list
    bdl/arctic_a0001
    bdl/arctic_a0002
    bdl/arctic_a0003
    ...
Put in all file names you wish to be used in training.

To run the training in the directory containing you wav/ and list/
directories

    $FESTVOXDIR/src/vc/scripts/VCTrain train awb bdl

Naming the original and target voice names.

The build takes some time depending on the number of files in the training
set, it could take tens of minutes to hours.

TESTING

Given the model you have just built, you can test it by converting some
other awb waveform files

    mkdir test
    mkdir test/wav
    mkdir test/wav/awb

Copy any files spoken by awb into test/wav/awb/

Then
    $FESTVOXDIR/src/vc/scripts/VCTrain test awb bdl

Converted waveforms will be generated in
    test/wav/awb-bdl/

FESTVOX Transformation Voice

These instructions help you build a full festival voice for the
target speaker based on an existing Festival diphone voice.

We assume the environment variables ESTDIR and FESTVOXDIR are set
to your versions of the Edinburgh Speech Tools code and FestVox
code, e.g.

   export ESTDIR=/home/awb/projects/speech_tools
   export FESTVOXDIR=/home/awb/projects/festvox

In order to get the basic directory structure we setup a
unit selection voice (even though we wont build one)

   mkdir cmu_us_awb
   $FESTVOXDIR/src/setup_clunits cmu us awb
   
We then setup this voice for transformation

   $FESTVOXDIR/src/vc/build_transform setup

If we are to build a US English voice, we can use the default_us
option which set up the first 30 sentences of the CMU arctic databases
and synthesize them with the default diphone voice (kal_diphone) to
be used as the source voice for conversion.  This diphone voice will 
be used and the constructed transformation filter will act on it.

   $FESTVOXDIR/src/vc/build_transform default_us

Now we must collect the target speech, the prompts are in
etc/txt.transform.data and we can collect the using prompt_them
or any other waveform recording tool, the resulting waveform
files should be in wav/.

   ./bin/prompt_them etc/txt.transform.data

Once collected, check they are recorded properly.  Now we can start
the actual training which may take up to an hour (for 30 sentences, or
can take longer for larger training sets).

   $FESTVOXDIR/src/vc/build_transform train

Once finished we can build the festvox voice wrapper for the constructed
transformation filter

   $FESTVOXDIR/src/vc/build_transform festvox

We can now run the voice

   festival festvox/cmu_us_awb_transform.scm
   ..
   festival> (voice_cmu_us_awb_transform)
   voice_cmu_us_awb_transform
   festival> (SayText "Hello, This is an example of a transformed voice.")

Finally you can build a distribution version of this voice.

   $FESTVOXDIR/src/vc/build_transform festvox_dist

The resulting distribution 

   festvox_cmu_us_awb_transform.tar.gz

Can be installed on other versions of festival, but becuase the filter
use binary programs it will only run on the same architectures as you
built the filter on.
