<chapter><title>Resources</title>

<para>
In this chapter we will try to list some of the important resources 
available that you may need when building a voice in Festival. This 
list cannot be complete and comprehensive but we will to give references 
to meta-resources as well as direct references to information code, data 
that may be of use to you. 
</para>
<para>
This document itself will be updated occasionally and it is worth 
checking to ensure that you have the latest copy. 
</para>
<para>
Updates, new databases, new language support etc will happen 
intermittently, new voices will be released which may help you 
develop your own new voices.

has been set up as a resource center for voices in Festival offering 
databases, examples and repository for voice distribution. Checking 
that site regularly is a good thing to do.

recorded diphone databases is also available as is, at

</para></listitem></varlistentry>
</variablelist>
Other databases, lexicons etc will be installed on festvox.org as 
they become available. 
</para>
<para>
There is also a mailing-list <filename>festvox-talk@festvox.org</filename> for 
discussing aspects of building voices. See 
<ulink url="http://festvox.org/maillist.html">
http://festvox.org/maillist.html</ulink> for details of joining it 
and the archive of messages already sent. Also, while traffic is low, 
feel free to mail the authors <filename>awb@cs.cmu.edu</filename> or 
<filename>lenzo@cs.cmu.edu</filename> and we will try to help where we can. 
</para>
<sect1><title>Festival resources</title>

<para>
The Festival home page <ulink
url="http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/">
http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/</ulink> It is updated
regularly as new developments happen.
</para>
<para>
The Festival Speech Synthesis System code and the Edinburgh Speech 
Tools library and related programs are available from 
<blockquote><literallayout>
<ulink url="ftp://ftp.cstr.ed.ac.uk/pub/festival/">
ftp://ftp.cstr.ed.ac.uk/pub/festival/</ulink>
</literallayout></blockquote>
or in the US at 
<blockquote><literallayout>
<ulink url="http://www.festvox.org/festival/downloads.html">
http://www.festvox.org/festival/downloads.html
</ulink>
</literallayout></blockquote>
Note that precompiled versions of the system are also available 
from that site, though at time of writing only Linux binaries are 
available. 
</para>
<para>
Festival comes with its own manual and html, postscript and 
GNU info format. It and a less comprehensive Speech Tools 
manual are pre-built in <filename>festdoc-1.4.1.tar.gz</filename>. The 
manuals are also available on line at 
<blockquote><literallayout>
<ulink url="http://www.festvox.org/docs/manual-1.4.2/festival_toc.html">
http://www.festvox.org/docs/manual-1.4.2/festival_toc.html</ulink>
<ulink url="http://www.festvox.org/docs/speech_tools-1.2.0/book1.html">
http://www.festvox.org/docs/speech_tools-1.2.0/book1.htm
</ulink>
</literallayout></blockquote>
You will likely need to reference these manuals often. 
</para>
<para>
It will also be useful to have access to other voices development 
in Festival as seeing how others solve problems may make 
things clearer. 
</para>
<para>
In addition to Festival itself a number of other projects throughout 
the world use Festival and have also released resources. The 
<quote><emphasis>Related Projects</emphasis></quote> links give urls to other organizations 
which you may find useful. 
</para>
<para>
<indexterm><primary> US English voices </primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary> Mexican Spanish </primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary> OGI </primary></indexterm>
It is worth mentioning Oregon Graduate Institute here who have done a 
lot of work with the system and release other voices for it (US English 
and Mexican Spanish). See <ulink url="http://cslu.cse.ogi.edu/tts/">
http://cslu.cse.ogi.edu/tts/</ulink> for more 
details. 
</para>
<para>
<indexterm><primary> MBROLA </primary></indexterm>
A second project worth mention, is the MBROLA project <citation>dutoit96</citation> 
<ulink url="http://tcts.fpms.ac.be/synthesis/mbrola.html">
http://tcts.fpms.ac.be/synthesis/mbrola.html</ulink>, they offer a 
waveform synthesis technique <citation>dutoit93</citation> and a number of diphone 
database for lots of different languages. MBROLA itself doesn't offer a 
front end, just phone, duration and F0 target to waveform synthesis. 
(However the do offer a full French TTS system too.) Their diphone 
databases complement Festival well and a number of projects use MBROLA 
databases for their waveform synthesis and Festival as the front end. 
If you lack resources to record and build diphone databases this is a 
good place to check for existing diphone databases for languages. Most 
of their databases have some use/distribution restrictions but they 
usually allow any non-commercial use.

<sect1><title>General speech resources</title>

<para>
The network is a vast resource of information but it is 
not always easy to find what you are looking for. 
</para>
<para>
<indexterm><primary> comp.speech </primary></indexterm>
Indexes to speech related information are available. The <filename>comp.speech</filename> 
frequently asked questions maintain by Andrew Hunt, is an excellent 
constantly updated list of information and resrouces available for 
speech recognition and synthesis. It is available in html format from

The Linguistics Data Consortium (LDC), although expensive, offers many 
speech resources including lexicons and databases suitable for 
synthesis work. There web page is <ulink url="http://www.ldc.upenn.edu">

A similar organization is the European Language Resources 
Association <ulink url="http://www.icp.grenet.fr/ELRA/home.html">
http://www.icp.grenet.fr/ELRA/home.html</ulink> which 
is based in Europe. Both these home pages have
