-h               Options help
-itype <string>  Input file type (optional).  If no type is
                 specified type is automatically derived from
                 file's header. Supported types
                 are: none, esps, est, est_binary, htk, htk_fbank, htk_mfcc, htk_mfcc_e, htk_user, htk_discrete, ssff, xmg, xgraph, ema, ema_swapped, ascii

-ctype <string>  Contour type: F0, track

-s <float>       Frame spacing of input in seconds, for unheadered input file

-startt <float>  Time of first frame, for formats which don't provide this

-c <string>      Select a subset of channels (starts from 0). 
                 Tracks can have multiple channels. This option 
                 specifies a list of numbers, refering to the channel 
                 numbers which are to be used for for processing. 

-start <float>   Extract track starting at this time, 
                 specified in seconds

-end   <float>   Extract track ending at this time, 
                 specified in seconds

-from  <int>     Extract track starting at this frame position

-to    <int>     Extract track ending at this frame position


-otype <string> {ascii}
    Output file type, if unspecified ascii is
    assumed, types are: none, esps, est, est_binary, htk, htk_fbank, htk_mfcc, htk_mfcc_e, htk_user, htk_discrete, ssff, xmg, xgraph, ema, ema_swapped, ascii, label

-S <float>       Frame spacing of output in seconds. If this is 
    different from the internal spacing, the contour is 
    resampled at this spacing 

-o <ofile>       Output filename, defaults to stdout


-info  Print information about file and header. 
    This option gives useful information such as file 
    length, file type, channel names. No output is produced

-track_names <string> 
    File containing new names for output channels

-diff Differentiate contour. This performs simple 
    numerical differentiation on the contour by 
    subtracting the amplitude of the current frame 
    from the amplitude of the next. Although quick, 
    this technique is crude and not recommende as the 
    estimation of the derivate is done on only one point

-delta <int> Make delta coefficients (better form of differentiate).
    The argument to this option is the regression length of 
    of the delta calculation and can be between 2 and 4 

-sm <float> Length of smoothing window in seconds. Various types of 
    smoothing are available for tracks. This options specifies 
    length of the smooting window which effects the degree of 
    smoothing, i.e. a longer value means more smoothing 

-smtype <string>  Smooth type, median or mean
-style <string>  Convert track to other form.  Currently only one form 
   "label" is supported. This uses a specified cut off to 
    make a label file, with two labels, one for above the 
    cut off (-pos) and one for below (-neg)

-t <float> threshold for track to label conversion 
-neg <string> Name of negative label in track to label conversion 
-pos <string> Name of positive label in track to label conversion 
-pc <string>  Combine given tracks in parallel.  If option 
     is longest, pad shorter tracks to longest, else if 
     first pad/cut to match first input track
