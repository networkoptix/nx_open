This repository contains the ARMs Universal Memory Provider userspace
library. This library is a requirement for ARMs binary Mali driver.

This software only depends on libc and a suitable kernel driver.

Direct Installation:
--------------------

Run:

> autoreconf -i
> ./configure
> make
> make install

to install libUMP into your system.

Debian package:
---------------

For this you will need to have the build-essential, autoconf and libtool
packages installed.

By running:

> dpkg-buildpackage -b

you will create debian packages suited for your system in the upper
level directory. The -b argument will build only binary packages and
will skip trying to create a source package from the git tree.
