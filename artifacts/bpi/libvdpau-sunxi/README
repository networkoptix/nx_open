This is an experimental VDPAU implementation for sunxi SoCs.

It supports decoding of MPEG1 and MPEG2, some limited MPEG4 types,
H.264 and on H3/A64 it also decodes H.265.


Requirements:

   libvdpau >= 1.1
   libcedrus (https://github.com/linux-sunxi/libcedrus)
   pixman (http://www.pixman.org)

Installation:

   $ make
   $ make install


Usage:

   $ export VDPAU_DRIVER=sunxi

   $ mpv --vo=vdpau --hwdec=vdpau --hwdec-codecs=all [filename]

Note: Make sure that you have write access to both /dev/disp and /dev/cedar_dev


Limitations:

Output bypasses X video driver by opening own disp layers.
You can't use Xv from fbturbo at the same time, and on H3 the video is
always on top and can't be overlapped by other windows.


OSD Support (not available on H3):

To enable OSD support for e.g. subtitles, set VDPAU_OSD environment
variable to 1:
   $ export VDPAU_OSD=1

To disable G2D mixer processor usage, set VDPAU_DISABLE_G2D environment
variable to 1:
   $ export VDPAU_DISABLE_G2D=1

This partly breaks X11 integration due to hardware limitations. The video
area can't be overlapped by other windows. For fullscreen use this is no
problem.
