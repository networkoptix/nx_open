/**
 * The mechanism allows to perform output (stdout, stderr) redirection to files.
 *
 * To activate redirection, the user must create special files in the directory
 * nx::kit::IniConfig::iniFilesDir(), named as follows:
 * `<executable-name-without-extension>_stdout.log`
 * and/or
 * `<executable-name-without-extension>_stderr.log`
 *
 * If such a file exists, the respective stream will be appended to the file contents.
 *
 * Redirection is performed during static initialization, thus, to ensure that it occurs before any
 * other output, this library should be the first in the list of linked libraries of the
 * executable. Note that in Windows due to some MSVC C++ Runtime issues, if any output occurs
 * before the redirection, the redirection may not work (the output disappears at all).
 *
 * If needed, this mechanism can be disabled defining a macro at compiling output_redirector.cpp:
 * -DNX_OUTPUT_REDIRECTOR_DISABLED.
