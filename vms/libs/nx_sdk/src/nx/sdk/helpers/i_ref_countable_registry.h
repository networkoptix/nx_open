 * Debugging mechanism that tracks ref-countable objects to detect leaks, double-frees and the

 *
 * An assertion will fail if any discrepancy is detected.
 *
 * The Server and each Plugin have their own instance of such registry, created and assigned to
 * each LibContext by the Server. Thus, each registry is tracking objects created/destroyed in the
 * respective library.
 *
 * The instance of a registry is destroyed when the LibContext destructor is called, i.e. on the
 * static deinitialization phase. On destruction, it attempts to detect and log objects which were
 * not deleted, failing an assertion if there are any such objects.
