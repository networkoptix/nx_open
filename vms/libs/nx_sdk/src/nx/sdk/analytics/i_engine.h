 * is created by the system administrator), and destroyed (via releaseRef()) on Mediaserver
 * shutdown (or when an existing Engine is deleted by the system administrator).

 * For the VMS end user, each Engine instance is perceived as an independent Analytics Engine
 * which has its own set of values of settings stored in the Mediaserver database.
