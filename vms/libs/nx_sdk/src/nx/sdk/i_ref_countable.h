/**
 * Base for all interfaces - abstract classes with only pure-virtual non-overloaded functions, so
 * that an object implementing an interface can be passed by pointer between dynamic libraries
 * compiled using potentially different compilers and their standard libraries. Such abstraction
 * is needed to enable plugins. It is somewhat similar to Microsoft Component Object Model (COM).
 *
 * Interface methods are allowed to use only C-style input and output types (without STL classes),
 * because on each side of a dynamic library different implementations/versions of STL can be used.
 * The only ABI aspects that interfaces rely upon - size of pointer, and order of methods in a VMT
 * (in the order of declaration, base class methods first). Overloaded methods are not allowed
 * because their order in VMS can be different across compilers. Also dynamic_cast can not be used
 * for such objects, because data structures behind the VMT can be different across compilers.
 *
 * Interfaces may contain type definitions and non-virtual inline utility methods (they will be
 * compiled by each side independently).
 *
 * Each object implementing an interface should have an internal reference counter, which, when
 * decremented to zero, triggers object deletion.
 *
 * To provide dynamic-cast-like behavior, and more generally, the ability to yield objects
 * implementing other interfaces (not necessarily the same object as the one being queried), each
 * object must implement queryInterface() which takes an interface identifier and returns a pointer
 * to the object implementing the requested interface.
 *
 * General rules for passing objects with reference counting:
 * - If a function returns a pointer to an interface, it should increment the counter prior to
 *     returning, thus, the counter should be decremented by the caller after using the object.
 * - If a function receives a pointer to an interface as an argument, it should not decrement its
 *     counter, and should not increment it (unless it needs the object to survive this call).
 * - If a class owns an object in a field, it should decrement its counter in the destructor.
 *
 * NOTE: For binary compatibility with old plugins, the VMT layout of this interface (4 entries -
 * destructor, queryInterface(), addRef(), releaseRef()) should not change, as well as the binary
 * prototypes (arguments and return values) of its entries.
