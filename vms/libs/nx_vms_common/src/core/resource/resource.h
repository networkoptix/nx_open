/**
 * One of the base VMS classes, QnResource, represents a database-stored entity and provides the
 * interface to modify it or to listen to the changes.
 *
 * Most noticeable descendant classes are:
 * - QnVirtualCameraResource - Device entity;
 * - QnUserResource - VMS User;
 * - QnMediaServerResource - VMS Server;
 * - QnLayoutResource - Layout of cameras.
 *
 * Most db-stored entities are Resources, though there are some exceptions (e.g. User Roles or
 * Showreels). Some entities are linked to others using child-parent relations by the parentId
 * field, e.g. Storages and Devices belong to Servers, and Layouts can belong to users or Video
 * Walls.
 *
 * All work with QnResource-based classes is done using special shared pointers (see
 * QnSharedResourcePointer). There are typedefs for each pointer type, e.g. QnResourcePtr for
 * the base class, or QnUserResourcePtr for the User class.
 *
 * Available Resources are stored in a special QnResourcePool instance. The primary key of the
 * Resource is its id. All work with the Resources (and listening to their changes) should be done
 * only with the Resources belonging to the Resources pool. Any class storing a shared pointer to a
 * Resource must listen to the Resource Pool signals to correctly clean up the pointer when the
 * Resource is removed from the Resource Pool.
 *
 * Some of the Resource parameters and properties are stored in separate classes but are accessible
 * using the QnResource methods. Default values for some of the properties are stored not for the
 * Resource itself but for the Resource type (see getTypeId() and QnResourceType).
 *
 * No Resource property should be modified by both the Client and Server simultaneously. That's why
 * some properties are stored as fields and some are stored externally (for example, see
 * CameraAttributesData). The same field can be written by a Server for one Resource type and by
 * a Client for another (e.g. a camera name is modified by a Server, but a User or a Layout name -
 * by a Client).
 *
 * NOTE: All class methods are thread-safe.
