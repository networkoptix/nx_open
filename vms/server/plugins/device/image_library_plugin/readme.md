This plugin provides access to a directory with image files using Camera Integration API (mainly,
by implementing `nxcip::DtsArchiveReader` interface).

Images from the specified directory are provided as a stream of frames with the specified duration
(in milliseconds). Images are read in unspecified order.

This plugin is provided as an example of integration and is not intended for production purpose.
