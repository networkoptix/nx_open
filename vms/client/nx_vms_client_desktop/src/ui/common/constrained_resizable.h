/**
 * This class is a workaround for a lack of mechanisms that would allow to 
 * create widgets with constant aspect ratio. 
 * 
 * Default sizeHint / sizePolicy system cannot help here because when passing 
 * constraint to effectiveSizeHint function, either width or height must not be set. 
 * If both are set, then you get your constraint back and the control never 
 * reaches the virtual sizeHint function. 
 * 
 * That is, there is no simple way to implement constant aspect ratio 
 * resizing using Qt-supplied functionality. So we introduce a separate 
 * interface for that.
