// A class that allows adding custom widgets to QLineEdit to the right of its text.
// Replaces QLineEdit built-in actions system which has very low flexibility and usability.
//
// Custom widgets are added by `addControls` and aligned from left to right.
// Line edit's layout direction is honored, in case of RTL direction widgets are aligned from
// right to left and the entire block is sticked to the left side of line edit.
//
// If custom widget has QSizePolicy::IgnoreFlag in its horizontal or vertical size policy,
// then it's width or height respectively is kept unchanged, otherwise the widget is resized to
// width or height of it's sizeHint constrained by minimumSizeHint, minimimSize and maximumSize.
// If the widget has QSizePolicy::ExpandFlag in its vertical size policy, it's expanded to
// full available height. QSizePolicy::ExpandFlag in horizontal size policy is ignored.
//
// Margins around custom widgets block are controlled with inherited contentsMargins property.
// Spacing between widgets is controlled with spacing property.
