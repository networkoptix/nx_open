# Structure is built on top of IP level abstraction.
# Hosts, which can reach each other on IP level, are considered as nodes located in one network.
# NAT networks are treated as separate networks. They cannot be reached from hypervisor.
# Some nodes can be in several networks but
# nothing is routed through them on IP level.
#
# In this example, *a* and *b* are both in two networks but they don't serve as router.
