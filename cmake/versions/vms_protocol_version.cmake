# VMS Protocol version defines compatibility between different VMS parts such as the Desktop Client,
# the VMS Server and the Cloud. Usually it should be increased when some API structures are changed
# and logical or network-level compatibility is lost.

# In-version Protocol number should be reset to 00 when updating the VMS version.
# ATTENTION: When changing the Protocol version, the corresponding changes must be added to the
# Cloud release branch. Inform the Team Lead of the Cloud team about the changes.
# ATTENTION: You must change the comment below to make sure it will generate a merge conflict if
# somebody concurrently updates the Protocol version. Prefer to use the Jira Issue id and title as
# a comment.
