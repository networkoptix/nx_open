Exposure time refers to the amount of time the sensor is exposed to light.
Short exposures result in less light, giving darker images whereas longer
exposures can flood an image with light, giving washed out images in the
presence of a lot of light. Additionally, motion blur is reduced under short
exposures and increased under long exposures.

High Speed enables a fixed exposure time, selectable from the
“Short Exposure” menu with values between 1 and 80ms. Low values will
reduce motion blur but may result in a noisier video. Ample illumination is
required to improve quality under very short exposures due to the lack of
captured light.

Speed enables short exposures ranging from 10-80ms. The
exposure time will increase with low light conditions.

Balanced enables medium exposures ranging from 20-80ms with
low light conditions resulting in a higher exposure time.

Quality enables longer exposures ranging from 40-200ms. Motion
blur may increase, but video will contain less noise under low light
conditions. Moon Light enables exposures of up to 500 ms if necessary. This
mode will result in more motion blur for fast moving objects."
