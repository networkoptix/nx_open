/**
 * This class should be inherited by any class that tends to provide asynchronous operation
 * through nx::network::aio.
 *
 * It implements AbstractPollable and simplifies asynchronous operation cancellation by introducing
 * BasicPollable::stopWhileInAioThread method.
 * It is recommended that BasicPollable::stopWhileInAioThread implementation can be safely
 * called multiple times.
 *
 * Sample implementation:
 * <pre><code>
 * class SampleClassWithAsyncOperations:
 *     public nx::network::aio::BasicPollable
 * {
 *     using base_type = nx::network::aio::BasicPollable;
 *
 * public:
 *     SampleClassWithAsyncOperations(std::unique_ptr<HttpConnection> httpConnection):
 *         m_httpConnection(std::move(httpConnection))
 *     {
 *         // Making sure this, m_httpConnection and m_timer are bound to the same AIO thread.
 *         bindToAioThread(m_httpConnection->getAioThread());
 *     }
 *
 *     virtual void bindToAioThread(aio::AbstractAioThread* aioThread) override
 *     {
 *         base_type::bindToAioThread(aioThread);
 *
 *         if (m_httpConnection)
 *             m_httpConnection->bindToAioThread(aioThread);
 *         m_timer.bindToAioThread(aioThread);
 *     }
 *
 *     void doSomethingAsync(CompletionHandler handler)
 *     {
 *         m_httpConnection->any_async_call(... handler);
 *     }
 *
 * protected:
 *     virtual void stopWhileInAioThread() override
 *     {
 *         base_type::stopWhileInAioThread();
 *
 *         m_httpConnection.reset();
 *         m_timer.pleaseStopSync();
 *     }
 *
 * private:
 *     // HttpConnection and aio::Timer inherit aio::BasicPollable.
 *
 *     std::unique_ptr<HttpConnection> m_httpConnection;
 *     aio::Timer m_timer;
 * };
 * </code></pre>
 *
 * See BasicPollable::pleaseStopSync() comment for more details.
 *
 * Successor to this class MUST support safe object deletion while in object's aio thread
 * (usually, it is acheived automatically).
 * QnStoppableAsync::pleaseStop and BasicPollable::stopWhileInAioThread are not called in this case.
 *
 * TODO #akolesnikov Name conflicts with Pollable. Consider renaming Pollable, AbstractPollable, BasicPollable.
