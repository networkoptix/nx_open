/**
 * \file
 *
 * This file contains forward-declarations for common collection types that are
 * handled by the serialization framework.
 *
 * They are here so that there is no need to explicitly enumerate them every
 * time a new format is added.
 *
 * Note that STL containers cannot be safely forward-declared (standard says
 * it's undefined behavior to define anything in STL namespace), so these
 * will still have to be included manually.
