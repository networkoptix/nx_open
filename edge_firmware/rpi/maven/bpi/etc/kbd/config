# This files tells the 'kbd' package:
#
# - whether to load a specific font and boot (and maybe a screen-font map,
#   but you should avoid that if possible).
# - whether to setup an Application-Charset Map other than the default CP437.
# - whether to do screen saver/DPMS settings
# - whether to change the keyboard rate/delay or the state of the
#   keyboard indicators 
# - whether to show a clock
#
# You can also specify per-VC settings by suffixing variable names as in
# the examples below. This only works on framebuffer devices.
#
# For consistency with the configuration file of console-tools the
# following variables and their _vcN versions are also supported:
# SCREEN_FONT, SCREEN_FONT_MAP and APP_CHARSET_MAP.
#
#
# Example:
#
#CONSOLE_FONT=iso01.f16
#CONSOLE_FONT_vc2=LatArCyrHeb-16
#
#CONSOLE_MAP=iso05
#CONSOLE_MAP_vc2=user
#
# Set the following - more euro-friendly default than kernel font.
#CONSOLE_FONT=latarcyrheb-sun16.psf

# Forget this one unless you _know_ it is necessary for your font:
#FONT_MAP=iso01

#  **** screen saver/DPMS settings: all VCs ****
# These settings are commented by default to avoid the chance of damage to
# very old monitors that don't support DPMS signalling.

# screen blanking timeout.  monitor remains on, but the screen is cleared to
# range: 0-60 min (0==never)  kernels I've looked at default to 10 minutes.
# (see linux/drivers/char/console.c)
BLANK_TIME=0

# blanking method (VESA DPMS mode to use after BLANK_TIME, before powerdown):
# on: the default, no DPMS signalling. near instant powerup, no power saving
# vsync: DPMS Standby mode. nearly instant recovery, uses 110/120W (17" screen)
# hsync: DPMS Suspend mode. typically 3s recovery, uses 15/120W (17" screen)
# powerdown,off: DPMS Off mode, typ. 10s recovery, uses  5/120W (17" screen)

# Those values are for my 17" Mag, but some monitors do suspend the same as
# standby.  xset dpms force {off|standby|suspend|on} is useful for this, if X
# supports DPMS on your video card.  Set X's DPMS screensaver with xset dpms
# or use option power_saver in XF86Config
#
# DPMS set by default to on, because hsync can cause problems on certain
# hardware, such as Armada E500 laptops
BLANK_DPMS=off

# Powerdown time.  The console will go to DPMS Off mode POWERDOWN_TIME
# minutes _after_ blanking.  (POWERDOWN_TIME + BLANK_TIME after the last input)
POWERDOWN_TIME=0


# rate and delay can get only specific values, consult kbdrate(1) for help
#KEYBOARD_RATE="30"
#KEYBOARD_DELAY="250"

# Turn on numlock by default
#LEDS=+num

# Display a clock in the right upper corner of the console by running vcstime
#DO_VCSTIME=yes
