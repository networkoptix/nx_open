----------------------------------------------2.3.0.8344-------------------------------------------
March 30, 2015
Since the release of v2.3 the we have been closely monitoring ongoing support issues and have found a few consistent bugs that we've decided to address in the form of an updated patch - Build 8344.

BUG FIXES IN 8344 BUILD
 - Android App update - slight update to the server and fixed display issues on Nexus 6 devices. The latest app is available for download now on Google Play.
 - Timeline recorded video fix - green segments for recorded video on the timeline were occasionally not displaying properly. This issue has been fixed.
 - Rare System Freeze - Two branches of code in v2.3 were conflicting and this resulted in the some users experienced a stoppage of recording, system merge failures, and slow camera loading. This issue has been fixed.
 - Non-IP Server Address Issue - the server hive environment worked incorrectly if servers  were set to address each other by DNS (rather than IP). This could lead to various intermittent problems.This issue has been fixed.
 - NAS storage issue - if NAS was in a system and then removed or unable to be discovered after an upgrade the Server pointed at that NAS address would take up to 10 minutes to start.

KNOWN ISSUES WITH BUILD 8344
 - This version does not contain Anti-Virus (BitDefender) fix. We're still working on it. As soon as we're done, we'll give you a patched version for installations using BitDefender.
 - Windows OS resizing issue - if double clicking on the application frame in computers running Windows the client does not always display properly. Still an issue - fix coming soon.

----------------------------------------------2.3.0.8212-------------------------------------------
Known Issues:

Client cannot run on Windows 2003/XP x64.
Server can’t be installed at some assemblies of windows Server 2008 and Windows Vista right from the box. It is necessary to download and install this package:
 - http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=29 for x86 version
 - http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=15336 for x64 version

Features:

Video Wall. Allows users to control unlimited number of monitors in the realtime mode. Requires Video Wall Licenses. To activate the feature it is necessary to have 5 licenses. Each license allows one operator to cotrol VW. To control Video Wall a user should have appropriate permissions

No Single Point of Failure. Previous versions the database was stored on Enterprise Controller. In case of EC failure the whole system was down. Now database is being replicated to each server, so there are no central component. If a server is down, the system continues working. Servers seamlessly synchronizing with each other. In this case the client will be reconnected to a different server that is currently alive (3247).

Failover. In case of server failure the cameras will be transferred to other servers (793 Automatic cameras move to reserve servers)

Server web page introduced. Unlike traytool, it allows users to manage server from a remote computer. Moreover it provides additional functionality to control Server: start/stop, change System ID, port, login and password, join to other systems, configure storages, gain server information

Server API & SDK. SDK provides an easy way to easily integrate various devices into VMS and API allows integrating third-party application with Server. API and SDK are available on the web page of Server.

Edge support. Due to decent architectural changes Server can be run on potentially any ARM device, including cameras that support EDGE technology. This allows running Server on a small low-cost boxes, or even without any dedicated server!

Universal Fisheye Dewarping. Now all type of fish-eye lenses are supported.

Max/Min Recording Time per Camera. Ability to specify the minimum and maximum amount of footage according to recording policies. This setting is per-camera. For instance, one camera can store only 3 days of storage and another-one at least 5 days.

One-Click System-Wide Upgrades. It is possible to upgrade the whole system(all servers even on different platforms) to a newer version or to a specific build from a single machine Client is rinning on (Administrative privilege required). If the system is in a isolated network, then the special file is created. If run this file, it will download the upgrade package to a jumpdrive. This jumpdrive should pe plugged in the computer Client is running on. After that the system can be updated in one click. If a client tries to connect to a different version of server, client will be updated automatically (3744)

Web Based Camera Settings. Ability to display camera's web page inside VMS to be able to fully control cameras. 

Access Control System (ACS) Integration: It is possible to display videos, related to a specific event, within ACS.

Web Client Removal. Redesigned web client will be introduced in the upcoming version. Mobile clients are still included.

#3738 Joining/Merging Systems and server to system (Other systems in resource tree). Now it is possible to join different systems. In this case the licenses will be combined (3246).  In order to join/merge servers/systems into one system - there is no need to go to each server separately. Servers/system could be merged with few clicks form the client or web admin interface.             

#3839 Simplified and flexible network setup between servers (Routing management). It is possible to specify IP addresses that can be used for accessing Servers (like public/internal IP addresses, domain names etc)

3593 System Administration - All system-related settings are combined in the single form to simplify setup and user experience.

Local Settings - All client-related settings are combined in the single form to simplify setup and user experience.

3334 Smart time synchronization. Servers can get the current time from the Internet. In offline mode it is possible to specify a "Master" server to synchronize time with (3826).

Improvements:
4269 It wasn't possible to drop camera to another server that does not physically see it. No it is and the camera will be displayed as "offline" until the new server is able to connect to it.

4139 It is possible to load images as a background
It is possible to change background color
3539 ctrl + alt + t to disable background animation
4641 Shadows removed from Scene's items

New localizations added

3687 Analog Encoder license
Video playback on live is smoother
3636 If user searches cameras on admin's layout, they appears on the Scene, but there was no way to save a new layout based on these cameras. "Save Layout As..." is added to the context menu.
2681 Storage index is located next to archive. That makes server startup much faster and the archive more redundant (rebuild is not needed when swapping drives as it used to be)
3881 3568 Main Menu and Context Menu reorganized

3569 Preview Search simplified
Introduced Ability to monitor all servers on a single layout
3496 In multi-server system the version of servers may be different as they are cross-compatible. However it is strongly recommended to have exact same builds to avoid issues and to simplify investigations in case of a problem. Thus, if there is Servers of other versions, they are displayed in red in the About dialog
3280 Mouse wheel zoom behavior changed when viewing several videos (used to be Mouse Wheel or ALT+Mouse Wheel)
3492 Now it is possible to set up E-Mail notifications template (System Settings).
3643 ESC behavior changed. Use Alt+Enter for fullscreen, ESC for cancel (ESC used to toggle fullscreen)
3707 3884 Login dialog improvements: admin is automatically put as username. Moreover session can be saved with password (If Auto-Login is checked and user saves the connection)
3672 Add possibility to delete invalid and expired licenses
3525 Ability to save camera rotation ("Force rotation" option on "Camera settings -> Default")
2466 Media server conflicts notification improved. Now message contains the specific list of cameras that are used by both servers.

3019 More default event rules are added: Event "Media server started" Action "Write to log" and E-mail Notification
3578 If connection to Server is lost, the appropriate message is displayed (used to be the notification in the right panel)
3258 Support streaming without transcoding to mobile devices (HLS). This may greatly reduce Server load
3629 Error messages when activating licenses improved
3353 Current version is displayed in the login dialog and the "beta version" form (used to be "About" form)
3582 It is possible to delete online cameras from resource tree. In this case camera may be discovered again after some time. To prevent it from re-discovering change the server auto-discovery setting
2269 If Login dialog is active it is possible to perform other actions with the interface (in previous version it was not allowed to interact with the client as soon as this dialog was active)
3551 3668 3687 3669 3688 License types reorganized: VMAX (DW only), SWarm (for ARM devices), Analog Encoder, Video Wall 
3486 Licenses information is moved to the separate database. This allows cleaning Server database without losing the license information
3575 It is possible to adjust rtsp transport per-camera (used to be per-server). 
3666 "Do not archive primary stream" option added. See expert camera settings
2694 Adjusted aspect ratios for some cameras to display them correctly
3137: Multi-video export dialog improved
3276: Generic rtsp/http links look neat in Resource tree
3167: Windows XP support
External storage support improved: Added external Storage support for Linux (1779), improved "Add external storage" for windows (#1779). Added ability to use password-protected external storage
#3595 Server logs contain memory and cpu usage
#3917 Added a new event "License issue". 
3423 Auto-discovery improved
Improved PTZ control
Onvif improvements
In 2.2 and early versions the number of servers were restricted (about 20). Now it is not
2900: Cameras with the same name are sorted by IP in Resources Tree
3160, 3110 3673 UI Animation is improved (especially if using E-Mapping 3023)
3883 If a user had unsaved layout, Client always asked to save them before exit. Now it is possible to disable such notification.

----------------------------------------------2.2.1.xxxx-------------------------------------------

Improvements:
1. Onvif protocol support is improved
2. Web client works better in Internet Explorer 9+
3. If screenshots are taken from a remote camera, then it can take a long to download it. Added progress bar to allow users to estimate time.
4. Default motion sensitivity changed from 6 to 5.

Bugs Fixed:
1. Fixed the installation error on Windows 8 and Windows Server 2008
2. Incorrect motion detection. Fixed.
3. Sometimes thumbnails could not be loaded on Android devices. Fixed
4. Better motion support for non-onvif cameras that are integrated through SDK.

6. Client crash during media folder check under some rare conditions. Fixed.
7. Update Feed url was broken. Fixed.

2.2.1.xxxx - Additional for Vista
Improvements:
1. Removed all screenshots with  HD Witness in Help.
2. Added ONVIF presets for VK2-1080PTZ and V2-Encoder.
3. Disabled presets for VK2-720VZMI and VK2-720VZMX.
4. Added focus for  VK2-600PTZ and VK2-Encoder.


2.2.1.xxxx - Additional for DW
Improvements:
5. Better PTZ support for DW cameras:
DWC-MB721M4TIR - Zoom/Focus is not supported, but displayed. Now we do not display PTZ controls at all
DWC-MB421TIR - PTZ Move is not supported, but displayed (only zoom supported). Now we display only zoom controls.
DWC-MB950TIR & DWC-MV950TIR - neither PTZ move nor Zoom are supported, but displayed (on the web page zoom/focus is displayed but doesn't work as well). Now we do not display PTZ controls at all
DWC-MPTZ20XFM - advanced PTZ (point and rectangle) did not work. Now advanced PTZ works well.
CP04 Encoder - Added ONVIF presets


----------------------------------------------2.2.0.xxxx-------------------------------------------

Features:
1. More easy network configuration: no more 3 ports to port forward( used to be EC port, Media Proxy port and Media Server port ). From now it's simply going to be one port only(normally 7001).
Also EC machine no longer needs to be able to connect to each MS. In order for client to be able to access video, MS should be able to connect to EC only, not vice versa any more. 
2. PTZ tours. PTZ tours are introduced together with "home position". Many different tours can be created and engaged. If user does not touch the camera for a while, camera can be moved to "home position" or default tour can be executed.
3. Added a new light skin. Introduced the option in System/Settings to switch between dark (regular) and light (introduced) skin.
4. Added a new events and actions:
    - Continuous sound action on "Motion on camera" and "Input signal on camera"
    - Disk is full (If user assined storage with no space in it for recording he will get red notification about it)
    - "Media server is started" diagnostic event 
5. Added a checkbox into installer "Allow server to optimize cameras settings". Enabled by default. If it's enabled than MS can changed stream settings for all new cameras. It gives an abbility to prevent server changing cameras settings at all.
   Also it can be changed for the current camera in "Camera settings" dialog.

8. Auto detection of new layout aspect ratio.
   - Default layout aspect ration is 16:9
   - if just one item is added, than layout AR is equal to the item's AR
   - if multiple items are added, than layout AR ia a peek the most common AR among this new items
9. Added possibility to fix aspect ratio for video resource: Added checkbox on "Camera settings -> Expert".
10. Generic http plugin.
11. Export progress dialog is not modal. (User can do other things while exporting operation is in progress.)

   - For screenshots. User click on button "Screenshot", dialog "Save Screenshot as" appears.
     There is Drop-Down List "Timestamps" at the bottom of dialog window. User can choose one of next value: No timestamp, Top left corner, Top right corner, Bottom left corner, Bottom right corner. 
   - For export selected area. The same Drop-Down List appears at the bottom of dialog "Export Video As".
     Drop-Down List "Timestamps" is disabled for .exe format.
13. A simple way to disable auto discovery: Added a new checkbox "Enable auto discovery" on "System settings -> Server"
14. Added a possibility to resize resource tree panel.
15. Added ability to calibrate fish-eye cameras. Calibration can be done automatically.
16. Added ability to run client in configuration mode. This mode is activated automatically if the client is rum on a weak PC (in terms of CPU and/or video adapter). This mode is restricted (all animations are turned off, there are no notifications and only one video can be viewed in the same time)


Improvements:
1. Added more default cameras' passwords for auto-discovery.
2. Fish eye flag is always available now. If enable "fish eye" flag, then PTZ is disabled for this camera.
3. Added vendor name to "Camera settings" and "Cameras' list".

14. Incompatible auto-found ECs in the Login Dialog is highlighted and EC version is displayed.
15. Added more informative messages on login dialog:
   - "You are trying to connect to incompatible Enterprise Controller.", If connect with different customizations.
   - "Wrong user or password", If connect with incorrect password/login.
   - If connection cannot be established, than leave the old message.
16. Improved license expiration warning message:
   - Dialog "License Expiration"is displayed only for Administrator
   - Dialog "License Expiration" is displayed once per day per client place on 15, 10, 5, 3, 2, 1 day before license will be expired.
   - Dialog is displayed only once after license is expired.
17. Changed default events accumulation time for default rules from "instant" to "30 second". It makes notification pannel much more useful.
18. The last minute of archive displays differently.
19. Introduced a setting in a software for video timeout:
    - Added checkbox "Auto pause video" on "System settings -> General"

----------------------------------------------2.1.0.xxxx-------------------------------------------

NEW FEATURES:
 - MAC Client is released!

NEW CAMERAS AND RECORDERS SUPPORTED:
 - Some specific ACTi cameras were not supported. Now they are. Additionally some Acti cameras are adjusted to support Dual-Streaming properly.
 - Vivotek support is improved: SD81X1 is supported and PTZ is fixed for Sd8111 and Sc83x1
 - In some cases analog encoders were found with wrong number of channels. Fixed 
 - New AXIS models are supported
 - Some cameras were reported wrongly as PTZ thus de-warping could not be enabled. Fixed
 - Added D-Link DCS-6010L 
 - Some advanced RTSP extensions are now supported that extends the potential cameras compatibility
 - New Arecont Vision cameras are supported (like XXXXv1X)
 - Dewarpinng for Arecont Vision is enabled (sometimes Arecont Vision cameras can be used with a fish eye lens)
 
IMPROVEMENTS:  
 - It is possible to choose separate analog channels for events
 - Linux media server stability is improved if working with large number of cameras (> 128)
 - If save a layout with existing name it was duplicated. Now it is suggested to overwrite it
 - License activation messages improved
 - Added Audio recording for ISD cameras and generic RTSP streams
 - If several storages are installed and their sizes differ, then storages are used smarter
 - If media servers and/or Enterprise Controller have different versions, then the warning is given. This helps to keep the system updated
 - Mouse Wheel does not effect in Scene zoom (was confusing for some users)
 - Media Server is optimized
 - If an exported layout is saved in media folder it appears under user as soon as user is logged in
 - Now it is possible to add any RTSP streams. Earlier it was not possible to view streams generated by specific Media servers (camera streams worked well).
 - If save layout with dewarped images – it will save all dewarping angles
 
BUGS FIXED:  
 - Linux Client created incorrect Media Folder un user's home directory. Fixed
 - If open Multi-Video it played back but did not display in the tree. Fixed
 - E-Mail templates displayed product name incorrectly. Fixed
 - Layout background (E-Mapping) didn't restor properly after logout. Fixed
 - If remove EC on Linux, mediaproxy process didn't stop. Fixed
 - Text to speech did not work properly on Linux. Fixed
 - If a new Media Server was installed this was not reflected in About screen until client restart. Fixed
 - Fixed the bug with incorrect Timeline display mode when DST shift occurs
 - If media server was restarted manually, it resulted in "Media Server restarted after crash" generation. Fixed
 - Network statistics did not work on Linux media servers on some network adapters. Fixed
 - Discovery and Arecont Streams were stuck in some network environments. (Arecont cameras are showing older recorded footage as live footage in spectrum). Fixed
 - While upgrading from 1.5 -> 2.0 some rare machine could lose licenses. Fixed
 - Generic RTSP sreams addition did not work on Linux server. Fixed.
 - Time was displayed incorrectly sometimes in multi-video export (time zone was not reflected). Fixed
 - If change SMTP server in advanced E-Mail settings, then the previous settings were restored if reopen the settings form. Fixed
 - x64 Client for Linux could not use images for E-Mapping in some cases. Fixed
 - Media Server could not be installed out-of the box on a clean Ubuntu machine. Fixed
 - Fixed false Camera IP conflict generation for generic RTSP streams
 - Linux Client could hang on NVidia cards if VSync was enabled
 - Zoom Windows on rotated items now displayed correctly
 - If flip a panoramic camera on its web page, then sensors could mix up. Fixed. The fix works as following: 
   once the flip is applied, the software recognizes it IF THE STREAM IS REOPENED. So, if the camera is not being recorded, it will be sufficient to just reopen it on Scene. 
   However, if the camera is being recorded, it will be necessary to either 
    - change the recording parameters, or disable recording, wait a bit then enable it, 
    - restart Media Server
 - If enable custom camera's streams control on Expert Camera Settings they are applied only until Media Server is restarted. Fixed 
 - External Storages (USB hard drives or Samba shares) that are offline could decrease writing speed. Fixed

NEW FEATURES:  
 - New license type is introduced. It will be used for analog cameras. Analog cameras are divided into 2 types:
   - DTS Based (i.e. VMAX Channels). For those cameras analog license is required for view live stream and archive (set on camera settings on the "General" tab). Recording is performed on DTS so the software only acruires recorded data from it.
   - Encoder channels (i.e. Flex Watch channels). Those cameras require a license for recording and may be viewed live without one. Recording is configured as usual. Such cameras are recorded directly by Media server.
 - License form is redesigned. Now the following data is displayed:
   - Licensed To - License Name and the provider the license has been obtained from
   - Type (analog/digital)
   - Expiration Date - specified only for trial licenses, "never" for permanent-ones
