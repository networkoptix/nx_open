1.1

New Cameras and Recorders Supported:
 - Sony
 - Exacq Recorder
 - Coldstore.

New Features:

 - It is possible to export in AVI format as well. This enables viewing exported video almost on any device.AVi is suggested by default. Mkv is still supported.
 - Mediaproxy feature allows viewing streams from cameras in different subnet. The only thing is needed is to forward Proxy port on the router. Client automatically switching to proxy if media server is not allowed directly. See documentation for details.
 - If adding a new storage to Media Server it is checked for validity and ability to write to.
 - Swap Camera Features works much better. If swap a camera to another server it is still streaming. Recording flag is set automatically on a new server. Also archive is combined from all servers.
 - Software Motion Detection allows grab motion detection from cameras not supporting Motion Map feature. However camera should support dualstreaming feature.
 - Watermark feature generates watermark for each exported file. If viewing exported files in HD Witness the watermark can be checked. If a file was modified the watermark check will fail.
 - Pan-temporal Timeline was completely redesigned.
 - Servers node in Resource tree is opened automatically if a user logs in.	
 - Exported videos are treated as cameras on slider.
 - Playback (live/archive navigation) is more accurate and smooth.

Bugs Fixed:
 - Export could not be performed if only one item is on the scene. It was necessary to select it first (the warning was displayed). Now it is selected automaticelly.
 - Sometimes status events could work incorrectly. This might result in "No Signal" in the camera along with streaming in the same time. Fixed.
 - Fixed a crash in HD Witness Client if search returns a huge number of results.
 - Server Name could not be changed. Fixed. 
 - In some cases Back button could work incorrectly in HD Witness Installer. Fixed.
 - If many items are on the scene and press the info button the info panels are resized inexpectedly. Fixed.
 - Fixed an error that occured if try to modify installed HD Witness (add or remove components).
 - RTSP Port wasn't checked for availability during the installation. Now it is.
 - SSE 2,3 and 4 is determined incorrectly in runtime for linux server. It might result in crash on some processors (Atom, Pentium 4, some AMD models etc). Fixed.
