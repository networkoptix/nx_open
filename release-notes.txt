Samsung caemras: SND-5061, SND-7061

----------------------------------------------2.1.0.xxxx-------------------------------------------

NEW FEATURES:
 - MAC Client is released!

NEW CAMERAS AND RECORDERS SUPPORTED:
 - Some specific ACTi cameras were not supported. Now they are. Additionally some Acti cameras are adjusted to support Dual-Streaming properly.
 - Vivotek support is improved: SD81X1 is supported and PTZ is fixed for Sd8111 and Sc83x1
 - In some cases analog encoders were found with wrong number of channels. Fixed 
 - New AXIS models are supported
 - Some cameras were reported wrongly as PTZ thus de-warping could not be enabled. Fixed
 - Added D-Link DCS-6010L 
 - Some advanced RTSP extensions are now supported that extends the potential cameras compatibility
 - New Arecont Vision cameras are supported (like XXXXv1X)
 - Dewarpinng for Arecont Vision is enabled (sometimes Arecont Vision cameras can be used with a fish eye lens)
 
IMPROVEMENTS:  
 - It is possible to choose separate analog channels for events
 - Linux media server stability is improved if working with large number of cameras (> 128)
 - If save a layout with existing name it was duplicated. Now it is suggested to overwrite it
 - License activation messages improved
 - Added Audio recording for ISD cameras and generic RTSP streams
 - If several storages are installed and their sizes differ, then storages are used smarter
 - If media servers and/or Enterprise Controller have different versions, then the warning is given. This helps to keep the system updated
 - Mouse Wheel does not effect in Scene zoom (was confusing for some users)
 - Media Server is optimized
 - If an exported layout is saved in media folder it appears under user as soon as user is logged in
 - Now it is possible to add any RTSP streams. Earlier it was not possible to view streams generated by specific Media servers (camera streams worked well).
 - If save layout with dewarped images – it will save all dewarping angles
 
BUGS FIXED:  
 - Linux Client created incorrect Media Folder un user's home directory. Fixed
 - If open Multi-Video it played back but did not display in the tree. Fixed
 - E-Mail templates displayed product name incorrectly. Fixed
 - Layout background (E-Mapping) didn't restor properly after logout. Fixed
 - If remove EC on Linux, mediaproxy process didn't stop. Fixed
 - Text to speech did not work properly on Linux. Fixed
 - If a new Media Server was installed this was not reflected in About screen until client restart. Fixed
 - Fixed the bug with incorrect Timeline display mode when DST shift occurs
 - If media server was restarted manually, it resulted in "Media Server restarted after crash" generation. Fixed
 - Network statistics did not work on Linux media servers on some network adapters. Fixed
 - Discovery and Arecont Streams were stuck in some network environments. (Arecont cameras are showing older recorded footage as live footage in spectrum). Fixed
 - While upgrading from 1.5 -> 2.0 some rare machine could lose licenses. Fixed
 - Generic RTSP sreams addition did not work on Linux server. Fixed.
 - Time was displayed incorrectly sometimes in multi-video export (time zone was not reflected). Fixed
 - If change SMTP server in advanced E-Mail settings, then the previous settings were restored if reopen the settings form. Fixed
 - x64 Client for Linux could not use images for E-Mapping in some cases. Fixed
 - Media Server could not be installed out-of the box on a clean Ubuntu machine. Fixed
 - Fixed false Camera IP conflict generation for generic RTSP streams
 - Linux Client could hang on NVidia cards if VSync was enabled
 - Zoom Windows on rotated items now displayed correctly
 - If flip a panoramic camera on its web page, then sensors could mix up. Fixed. The fix works as following: 
   once the flip is applied, the software recognizes it IF THE STREAM IS REOPENED. So, if the camera is not being recorded, it will be sufficient to just reopen it on Scene. 
   However, if the camera is being recorded, it will be necessary to either 
    - change the recording parameters, or disable recording, wait a bit then enable it, 
    - restart Media Server
 - If enable custom camera's streams control on Expert Camera Settings they are applied only until Media Server is restarted. Fixed 
 - External Storages (USB hard drives or Samba shares) that are offline could decrease writing speed. Fixed

NEW FEATURES:  
 - New license type is introduced. It will be used for analog cameras. Analog cameras are divided into 2 types:
   - DTS Based (i.e. VMAX Channels). For those cameras analog license is required for view live stream and archive (set on camera settings on the "General" tab). Recording is performed on DTS so the software only acruires recorded data from it.
   - Encoder channels (i.e. Flex Watch channels). Those cameras require a license for recording and may be viewed live without one. Recording is configured as usual. Such cameras are recorded directly by Media server.
 - License form is redesigned. Now the following data is displayed:
   - Licensed To - License Name and the provider the license has been obtained from
   - Type (analog/digital)
   - Expiration Date - specified only for trial licenses, "never" for permanent-ones
 - Windows 8 is supported
 - E-Mails are introduced for Users. Each user is advised to have an e-mail. These e-mails will be used for notifications (see below)
 - Intuitive Mail Server settings. It is necessary to specify e-mail address and password of the account that is intended to be used for mail notifications. The system will do the rest. Additional parameters are available as well
 - client of any version can talk to any EC version
 - Events and Actions:
   - Events: 
     - Motion (camera(s) must be specified). Camera(s) must have Recording enabled
     - Camera Disconnected (specific camera(s) may be specified). If not, any camera will trigger the event
     - Storage Failure (in case Media Server is unable to write a file on a storage)
     - Network Issue (RTP timeout or RTP packet loss)
     - Camera IP Conflict (if several cameras or servers have the same IP address)
     - Input Signal on Camera (if supported - ONVIF and Axis only)
     - Media Server Failure (in case Media Server goes down or reboots itself)
     - Media Servers Conflict (if another Media Server that connected to another EC is pulling video from the same camera(s))
	 - EC Connection Lost (results in notifications only)
	 - Licenses are not configured (results in notifications only for Admin)
	 - E-mail is not set (results in notifications only). Admin gets notifications about all users that have not emails specified
	 - Storages are not configured properly (results in notifications only for Admin)
   - Actions: 
     - Camera Recording (camera(s) must be specified). Camera(s) must have Recording enabled
     - Panic Recording
     - Send Mail (user(s) and additional recipient(s) must be specified). Mail Server settings should be configured in Global Settings
     - Show Notification (User roles may be specified). Notification parameters should be configured in Global Settings
     - Camera Output(if supported - ONVIF and Axis only)     
   - Each event/action is grouped in Rule. Rules can be configured in the Advanced Event Rules form (CTRL + E). Each rule has standard and advanced parameters
 - Hardware acceleration of video decoding (Intel Quick Sync only). The flag in System Settings will be available only if Intel HD graphics is enabled
 - PTZ is greatly improved:
   - PTZ is now more intuitive and precise
   - PTZ now works correctly for rotated/flipped Axis cameras
   - PTZ positions can be saved/restored (if a camera supports positioning)
   - The current view can be zoomed in a specific position (just draw a rectangle to zoom into or use Double Click to zoom out). Must be supported by the camera.
 
IMPROVEMENTS:
 - Onvif support is improved so more ONVIF compliant cameras are supported
 - Storage Dialog is significantly redesigned. Now it is not necessary to specify the folder for the recording data, it is necessary to select the disks the recording will be performed to and the amount of free space to preserve. The software will do the last.
 - CTRL can be used in Calendar Search to select multiple dates
