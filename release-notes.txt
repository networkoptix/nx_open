----------------------------------------------- 1.2 -----------------------------------------------

New Cameras and Recorders Supported:
 - All Onvif-supported devices are supported now

New Features:
 - Thumbnails are introduced. They are displayed on the top of Pan-temporal Timeline. Available for local files too
 - It is possible to record audio from cameras that support this feature and have the microphone
 - New recording type is introduced. Now it is possible to record in low quality everytime but swith to high quality when motion occurs
 - Software Motion detection is much more accurate
 - Smart Search and Motion Detection Configuration is redesigned: 
   - a quick button appears on the video to enable/disable smart search mode
   - Smart Search region selection is much more intuitive now
   - Motion Detection configuration works much more intuitive now
 - If mediaserver changes its IP address it is detected without restart
 - If adding or changing a storage on Media Server the amount of free space is checked too
 - Port selection algorithm is changed: now the sequential ports are suggested. It allows to simplify port forwarding: now it is possible to make a single port forwarding rule for the port range
 - Security fixes:
   - All system components are using SSL
   - EC Passwords are hidden in the installer screens (it is suggested to enter it twice)
 - At the end of install process it is suggested to run the client
 - Context menu from the lower scroll panel is removed
 - It is possible to change grid cells' aspect ratio on Scene. It can be useful for 16:9 cameras. Also it is possible to adjust items' distance using Context Menu

 
Bugs Fixed:
 - If view a video in full screen buttons (info and close) were overriden by top panel and thus inaccessible. Now the fullscreen video can be zoomed out a bit and those buttons can be pressed
 - Panoramic cameras are resized correctly
 - Cameras' Info Panel fixes:
   - If fps is greater than 100 it was displayed as 1.1E+02 on the info panel. Fixed
   - it is possible to see the current camera's resolution on camera's info panel   
 - Archive (green chunks) can be shown incorrectly on Pan-Temporal Time Line if a camera was swapped between servers. Fixed.
 - In some cases recording by motion might not work on cameras if software motion detection is selected. Fixed
 - If change media storage the old one could be using as well. Fixed.
 - Pan-Temporal Time Line zoom could could work incorrectly in long archive (several months). Fixed.
 - Smart search could work incorrectly sometimes if an archive was longer than 1 month
 - Unicode Names (on native alphabets) were displayed incorrectly in license information. Fixed
 - Sometimes tree items appeared at the root of the tree. Fixed

----------------------------------------------- 1.1 -----------------------------------------------

- Linux server officially released 

New Cameras and Recorders Supported:
 - Some Sony, Brickcom, Axis and Iq camera models
 - Axis Encoders
 - Coldstore

New Features:

 - It is possible to export in AVI format as well. This enables viewing exported video almost on any device.AVi is suggested by default. Mkv is still supported
 - Mediaproxy feature allows viewing streams from cameras in different subnet. The only thing is needed is to forward Proxy port on the router. Client automatically switching to proxy if media server is not allowed directly. See documentation for details
 - If adding a new storage to Media Server it is checked for validity and ability to write to
 - Swap Camera Features works much better. If swap a camera to another server it is still streaming. Recording flag is set automatically on a new server. Also archive is combined from all servers
 - Software Motion Detection allows to do advanced motion detection with very precise and flexible motion mask(camera should support dualstreaming feature). It almost does not require additional CPU usage
 - Watermark feature generates watermark for each exported file. If viewing exported files in HD Witness the watermark can be checked. If a file was modified the watermark check will fail
 - Pan-temporal Timeline was completely redesigned
 - Servers node in Resource tree is opened automatically if a user logs in
 - Exported videos are treated as cameras on slider
 - Playback (live/archive navigation) is more accurate and smooth

Bugs Fixed:
 - Export could not be performed if only one item is on the scene. It was necessary to select it first (the warning was displayed). Now it is selected automaticelly
 - Sometimes status events could work incorrectly. This might result in "No Signal" in the camera along with streaming in the same time. Fixed
 - Fixed a crash in HD Witness Client if search returns a huge number of results
 - Server Name could not be changed. Fixed
 - In some cases Back button could work incorrectly in HD Witness Installer. Fixed
 - If many items are on the scene and press the info button the info panels are resized inexpectedly. Fixed
 - Fixed an error that occured if try to modify installed HD Witness (add or remove components)
 - RTSP Port wasn't checked for availability during the installation. Now it is
 - SSE 2,3 and 4 is determined incorrectly in runtime for linux server. It might result in crash on some processors (Atom, Pentium 4, some AMD models etc). Fixed
