Network server used by two unbound hosts each behind its own NAT to establish connection using UDP hole punching.
UDP hole punching is described at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UDP_hole_punching. In terms of wiki article, this is S host.

Listens public UDP port

Implemented using UDT (http://udt.sourceforge.net/)

Let H1 be host behind NAT1 which wishes accepts incoming connections
H2 behind NAT2 is a host which wants to connect to H1
S is this module
