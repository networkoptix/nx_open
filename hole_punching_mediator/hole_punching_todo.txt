Notes on address resolving

- connection that requires interaction with mediator will be called "cloud connection", target address of this connection is called "cloud address"
    - distinguishing traditional/cloud addresses: if hostname is an ip-address or can be resolved locally, then using traditional sockets. 
        Otherwise, establishing cloud connection
    - cloud address following format: {server_id}.{system_name} or just {system_name}. In the latter case mediator is expected to select mediaserver, 
        nearest to the client (by using some third-party ip address DB)
    - resolving host name is done in the following way:
        - using local dictionary of peers. Address is added to this dictionary after peer has been found by multicast or by added manually by user
        - by gethostbyname function


!!!! In general, hole punching implementation MUST be as close to sockets as possible. That is, it MUST be hidden behind abstract socket API 
    so that to minimize existing code refactoring !!!!



Implementation decomposition:

1. add UDT support to sockets
    (done) 1.1. implement AbstractCommunicatingSocket, AbstractServerSocket using UDT
    (done) 1.2. add UDT support to aio
        (done) 1.2.1. implement PollSet via UDT
        (done) 1.2.2. AIOThread: must be able to use different Pollset (for system sockets and UDT sockets)
        1.2.3. AIOService:
            (done) - must be able to use different aio threads for different socket types (system sockets and UDT sockets)
            - MUST be able to specify thread count for system sockets and for UDT sockets
            (done) - make AIOService non-public. Socket async API must be used instead. This will allow AIOService to accept specific socket type, 
                not AbstratSocket and select AIOThread type on compile-time

2. mediator implementation
    - some authentication shoud be implied to allow only networkoptix modules to talk to the mediator

    2.1. async connection server. It will be used as a base for STUN API and (possibly) HTTP API
        (done) - must be abstracted from protocol type
        (done) - better use templates instead of abstract classes
    2.2. STUN server implementation
        2.2.1. STUN message/notification parser/serializator
        2.2.2. implement standard STUN logic: retrieval of public IP address
        2.2.3. implement custom STUN requests (bind, connect, connection_requested)
        2.2.3. Re-routing requests to another mediator instance. If server is listening on another mediator, MUST re-route incoming connection request to that server
    2.3. HTTP API
        2.3.1. implement register/unregister requests
        2.3.2. in the future some statistics gathering requests may be added
    2.4. DB layer. Used to store information about registered systems
        - selection is based on what could hosting provide
        - although, SQL is not required at the moment, it may be required in the future, so better use cloud SQL DB
    2.5. Cloud layer. Used to store information about currently on-line servers, listening for incoming cloud connections
        - mediators MUST share on-line information about listening servers
        - it would be great to use same code as used to synchronise data between EC2 peers
    2.6. (low priority) search of mediaserver nearest to the connection peer. Should use some IP address DB
    2.7. (low priority) load-balancing between mediators
        - mediators, placed in same region, can re-route bind requests to each other to balance load

3. host name resolving
    - add address table to be used to resolve address
    - all found peers MUST be placed into this table
        - peer address looks like {peer_id}.{system_name}

4. hole punching itself
    Peers first setup UDT tunnel, than verify each other via that tunnel and than establish connection using this tunnel.
    So, we always have n+1 cloud connection. One - for internal purposes

    4.1. add hole punching server connections manager
        4.1.1. registers in mediator(s?) and listens for incoming hole punching connections
            - mediator may suggest another mediator for listening
        4.1.2. after receiving connection request it sets up UDT tunnel to initiating host using rendezvous UDT connection

        Sample hole punching server declaration:
            class CloudConnectionsServer
            {
            public:
                /*!
                    \a handler has following type: ( ErrorCode, UDTConnection* )
                */
                bool acceptAsync( handler );
            };

    4.2. hole punching client connections manager
        4.2.1. when user calls socket.connect implying hole punching, it 
            - connects to the closest mediator instance and requests connection to the server
            - mediator can re-route request to another mediator instance
                - client should remember mediator it used to connect to peer
            - sets up hole punching tunnel to the requested host by using rendezvous UDT connection
        4.2.2. futher connection initiation should be done by direct interaction via existing tunnel
            - tunnel should live some time after last connection has been closed

    4.3. tunneling should be managed by same class on server and client side
        Sample tunnel class declaration:
            class CloudTunnel
            {
            public:
                /*!
                    \a handler has following type: ( ErrorCode, UDTConnection* )
                    \note No address specified since tunnel created between two peers and address is per tunnel, not per connection
                */
                bool connectionAsync( handler );

            signals:
                void newConnectionAccepted( UDTConnection* );
                void tunnelClosed( reason );
            };

5. get rid of QT sockets in client:
    5.1. refactor mediaserver API in client
        - api should be async and type safe
        - should use code from ec2 api as much as possible

6. registering system in cloud
    6.1. 
        - registration is initiated automatically during first mediaserver start
        - mediaserver connects to mediator and calls "register", providing its system name
        - if system name is unique, mediator generates some authentication key, saves system name / authentication key in DB and responses with authentication key
        - if system name is not unique, message should be shown to the client, offering him to change system name to an unique value

    6.2. (low priority) Some administration tools should be added to allow view/change/delete registrations, find unused registrations, etc..
