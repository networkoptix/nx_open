<h2>Developer Resources</h2><p>Go ahead. Develop something amazing with our API and SDK</p><h3>Server API</h3><p>The Server API provides a standart set of API calls for 3rd party systems. Using the Server API developers have the ability to access nearly every feature availible in the system's thick client, including - but not limited to - the ability to query/manage system resources (servers, cameras, users), manage users and permissions, pull live or recorded video out of the system, generate events, create rules, control PTZ cameras, and more.</p><p><a href="api.xml" target="_blank">API Documentation</a></p><h3>Video Source Integration SDK</h3><p>The Video Source Integration SDK enables easy integration of any video source (live or archived) into the system. With the SDK it's possible to create a method for discovering, displaying, analyzing and recording video from virtually any live or recorded video source (IP Cameras, NVR's, DVRs, etc). It also allows for integrating device I/O's and motion detection information.</p><p><a ng-href="#/sdkeula/">Download SDK</a></p>
