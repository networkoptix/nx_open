        <h3>เซิร์ฟเวอร์ API</h3>
        <p>
            Server API provides a standard set of API calls for 3rd party systems. It gives developers the ability to
            access almost every system feature available in the regular client: query/manage system resources (servers,
            cameras, users, permissions), pull live or recorded video out of System, generate events, create rules,
            control PTZ cameras, and more.

        <h3>Storage SDK</h3>
        <p>
            Storage SDK provides the ability to integrate potential storage  into System. It allows developers to
            read from or write to any storage location: local, remote, and even cloud one. Creating a storage
            plugin requires implementing standard functions such as: I/O stream, if file exist, delete file, list of
            files in the folder, etc.Storage SDK also contains an example for using an FTP server as a storage location.
