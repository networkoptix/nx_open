        <h3>Server API</h3>
        <p>
            The Server API provides a standard set of API calls for 3rd party systems.
            Using the Server API developers have the ability to access nearly every feature available in the system's thick client,
            including - but not limited to - the ability to query/manage system resources (servers, cameras, users),
            manage users and permissions, pull live or recorded video out of the system, generate events, create rules,
            control PTZ cameras, and more.

        <h3>Video Source Integration SDK</h3>
        <p>
            The Video Source Integration SDK enables easy integration of any video source (live or archived) into the system.
            With the SDK it's possible to create a method for discovering, displaying, analyzing and recording video from virtually
            any live or recorded video source (IP Cameras, NVR's, DVRs, etc). It also allows for integrating device I/O's and motion detection information.

        <h3>Storage SDK</h3>
        <p>
            The Storage SDK enables easy integration of any potential storage.
            Using the Storage SDK developers can read from or write to any storage location - locally available, remote storage, and even cloud servers.
            Creating a storage plugin requires implementing standard functions such as I/O stream, if file exist, delete file, list of files in the folder, etc.
            The Storage SDK also contains an example for using an FTP server as a storage location.
