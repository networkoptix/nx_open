    <h2>Developer Resources</h2>
    <p>Go ahead. Develop something amazing with our API and SDK</p>
    <h3>Server API</h3>
    <p>
        The Server API provides a standard set of API calls for 3rd party systems.
        Using the Server API developers have the ability to access nearly every feature available in the system's thick client,
        including - but not limited to - the ability to query/manage system resources (servers, cameras, users),
        manage users and permissions, pull live or recorded video out of the system, generate events, create rules,
        control PTZ cameras, and more.

    <h3>Video Source Integration SDK</h3>
    <p>
        The Video Source Integration SDK enables easy integration of any video source (live or archived) into the system.
        With the SDK it's possible to create a method for discovering, displaying, analyzing and recording video from virtually
        any live or recorded video source (IP Cameras, NVR's, DVRs, etc). It also allows for integrating device I/O's and motion detection information.

    <h3>Storage SDK</h3>
    <p>
        Storage SDK enables easy integration of any potential storage to the system.
        With SDK you can make server record to and read back data from anything that can store data, starting from ftp server and ending with any online storage (google drive and such).
        To create a storage plugin basic functions need to be implemented such as: I/O stream, if file exist, delete file, list of files in the folder etc.
        SDK contains example of storage plugin which uses FTP server as a storage.
