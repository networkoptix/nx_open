        <h3>Generic Events Generator</h3>
        <p>
            A Generic Event is a method of sending events from 3rd party systems to a System
            which can be used to trigger System actions in the Events & Rules engine.
            The Generic Event Generator is a tool which helps developers and integrators build
            and test HTTP Generic Event calls.

        <h3>Video Source SDK</h3>
        <p>
            The Video Source SDK provides the ability to integrate almost any live or recorded video source (IP Cameras,
            NVRs, DVRs, etc) into System and makes it possible to create methods for discovering, displaying, analyzing
            and recording video. It also allows integrating I/O ports and devices, as well as pulling motion detection
            information from 3rd party devices.

        <h3>Storage SDK</h3>
        <p>
            The Storage SDK allows developers to read from or write to any storage location: local, remote, and even
            cloud one. Creating a storage plugin requires implementing standard functions such as: I/O stream, if file
            exist, delete file, list of files in the folder, etc. The Storage SDK contains an example for using an FTP
            server as a storage location.
