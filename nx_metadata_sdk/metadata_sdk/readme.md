# Introduction

This package provides an SDK to create video analytics plugins for Nx Witness VMS.

From business logic point of view, a Metadata Plugin is connected to a video camera, may receive
video frames from the camera or interact with the camera using a certain proprietary way, and may
generate metadata - events and objects (rectangles on a frame) - which is sent to Mediaserver to be
stored in its database and visualized in Client.

From developers point of view, a Metadata Plugin is a dynamic library (`.dll` on Windows, `.so` on
Linux) which exports a single function referred to as the "entry function". The entry function is a
factory for objects inherited from a dedicated SDK abstract class (in other words, implementing a
dedicated interface) `class PluginInterface` declared in `src/plugins/plugin_api.h`. This header
file also defines (in a comment) the name, prototype and linkage type of the entry function.

To make it possible to develop plugins using a different C++ compiler (e.g. with incompatible ABI)
rather than the one used to compile Nx Witness VMS, or potentially in languages other than C++,
a COM-like approach is offered: all objects created in a plugin inherit abstract classes declared
in header files of this SDK, which have only pure virtual functions with C-style arguments (not
using C++ standard library classes). To manage lifetime of such objects, they have a reference
counter.

The SDK C++ files have extensive documentation in Doxygen format, included within the SDK as HTML.

# Helper tools

To simplify implementation of a plugin, a number of helper classes are provided with this SDK that
implement the SDK interfaces and handle such complexities as reference counting and interface
requesting. Such classes are typically named starting with `Common`. If such a helper class does
not address all the requirements of a plugin author, it may be subclassed or not used at all - a
plugin can always implement everything from scratch using just interfaces from header files.

Also, some tools are provided with this SDK, which are recommended though not required to be used:

- Header-only library `src/plugins/plugin_tools.h` which handles reference counting and GUID
transforming.

- Pure C++ library `nx_kit` (which itself is an independent project with its own documentation)
that offers convenient debug output (logging) and support for .ini files with options for
experimenting (e.g. switching alternative implementations, or parameterizing the code), and a
rudimentary framework for simple unit tests.

# Sample: building and installing

This package includes a sample Metadata plugin written in C++: `Stub Metadata Plugin`, located at
`samples/stub_metadata_plugin/`. It receives video frames from a camera, ignores them, and
generates stub metadata objects looking as a rectangle moving diagonally across the frame, and also
some hard-coded events. This plugin has certain settings which allow to test various SDK features,
see `samples/stub_metadata_plugin/stub_metadata_plugin_ini.h` for details.

The included `Stub Metadata Plugin` source files can be compiled and linked using CMake, yielding
`stub_metadata_plugin.dll` on Windows, or `libstub_metadata_plugin.so` on Linux.

Prerequisites:
```
CMake >= 3.3.2
Windows (7 or 10): Microsoft Visual Studio >= 2015
Linux (Ubuntu 16.04) (including Nvidia Tegra native compiling): g++ >= 5.4.0, make or Ninja
Nvidia Tegra cross-compiling: aarch-64 g++ >= 5.4.0 (e.g. Linaro), make or Ninja
```

To compile the sample, and (if not cross-compiling) run unit tests, execute the commands collected
into the provided scripts (use their source code as a reference):
```
# Windows:
...\metadata_sdk\build_sample.bat

# Linux or Windows with Cygwin:
.../metadata_sdk/build_sample.sh

# Nvidia Tegra cross-compiling (64-bit ARM):
# NOTE: The file nvidia_tegra_toolchain.cmake defines which cross-compiler will be used.
.../metadata_sdk/build_sample_nvidia_tegra.sh
```

On Windows, after CMake generation phase, Visual Studio GUI can be used to compile the sample:
open `.../build/stub_metadata_plugin.sln` and build `ALL_BUILD` project.

After successful building, locate the main built artifact:
```
# Windows:
...\metadata_sdk-build\Debug\stub_metadata_plugin.dll

# Linux:
.../metadata_sdk-build/libstub_metadata_plugin.so
```

To install the plugin, just copy its library file to the dedicated folder in the Nx Witness
Mediaserver installation directory:
```
# Windows:
C:\Program Files\Network Optix\Nx Witness\MediaServer\plugins\

# Linux:
/opt/networkoptix/mediaserver/bin/plugins/
```
ATTENTION: After copying the plugin library, Media Server has to be restarted.
