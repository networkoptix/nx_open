 * Reads and decodes protocol message fields.

 * This class contains two kinds of methods:  methods that read specific
 * protocol message constructs and field types (e.g. {@link #readTag()} and
 * {@link #readInt32()}) and methods that read low-level values (e.g.
 * {@link #readRawVarint32()} and {@link #readRawBytes}).  If you are reading
 * encoded protocol messages, you should use the former methods, but if you are
 * reading some other format of your own design, use the latter.
