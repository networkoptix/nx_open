        <h2>Remote connectivity</h2>
        <p class="help-topic">
            Sometimes it's possible to connect to the system from one network/place and impossible from another.
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to get remote connectivity to work without port forwarding, DDNS, VPN etc, software has to "punch
            the UDP hole" on the client side as well as on the server side. Success depends on many factors such as
            router model/firmware, ISP network type (cell, cable, wi-fi) and infrastructure, country etc.<br>
            In spite of working well in general, it may not work in a particular case.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>The issue could be fixed by manual port forwarding setup. DDNS is never needed (even with non-static
                public IP address).</b>

        <p class="help-topic">
            Cloud systems merging is not supported at the moment.
            A local system could be merged with the cloud one at any given time. So in order to merge 2 cloud systems
            one should be disconnected from the cloud.

            Cloud credentials cannot be used to connect to the system which has no Internet at the moment.
            In order to connect to such system locally (such as "admin") local user login credentials should be used.
