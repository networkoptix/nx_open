Under no circumstances will the preprinted terms of any service order or any other terms apply to this Agreement. No waiver of any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement will be binding for any purpose unless made in writing and signed by authorized representatives of both parties and any such waiver will be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose given. No failure or delay on the part of either of the parties in exercising any right will operate as a waiver, nor will any single or partial exercise by either of the parties of any right preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right. All notices, consents and approvals under this Agreement must be delivered in writing by overnight delivery with a tracking system, personal delivery, or certified mail, postage pre-paid, to the other party at its address set forth above or at such other address as may be later designated by such party.

This Agreement will be governed by the laws of the %LEGAL_COMPANY_JURISDICTION% without regard to conflicts of law principles. All disputes arising under this Agreement must be brought in the %LEGAL_COMPANY_COURT%. Each party irrevocably hereby consents to the jurisdiction and venue of any such court in any such action or proceeding. This Agreement constitutes the entire, final and exclusive agreement between the parties regarding the subject matter hereof, and supersede all prior or contemporaneous agreements, understandings, discussions, negotiations and communications, whether written or oral, express or implied.</p>",
