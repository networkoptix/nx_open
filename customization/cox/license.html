   4. LIMITED
WARRANTY.
  </p>
  <p class="western" lang="en-US" style="margin-bottom: 0in">
   The
Program is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind,
either express or implied, including but not limited to the implied
warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose
and those arising by statute or otherwise in law or from a course of
dealing or usage of trade.  The entire risk as to the quality and
performance of the Program is with you.  Some states and provinces do
not allow the exclusion of implied warranties so the above exclusion
may not apply to you.

   Cox
Communications does not warrant that the functions contained in the
Program will meet your requirements or that the operation of the

   In no
event will Cox Communications or its licensors be liable to you or
any third party for any indirect, incidental or consequential damages
(including without limitation lost profits, lost savings or lost

possibility of such damage or claim. In no event will Cox
Communications’s direct liability under or arising out of this
Agreement, whether in contract or in tort, exceed the amount paid by
you for the Program.  Some states and provinces do not allow the
limitation or exclusion of liability for incidental or consequential
